What will be the result of the technological disruption on the global employment, in the next 10 years, on a capitalist bases??
What will be the influence of technological development on the global surplus value of capitalist production??

Hi Kartik,
Are you taking action to get this proposal in front of the Trump transition team?

Hi James,

I would certainly like to, but don't have a direct contact there.  Sending it cold would get lost within thousands of letters..

Hi KG,

I love your whitepaper.  You've clearly sunk a ton of time and effort into this and it shows.  Your solution is elegant and if I had a steady check coming in, I would relax and focus on other ventures (making more contributions to ATOM.)

I don't intend to be spammy (not my intent), but if someone could please answer my question in this instance, I'd really appreciate it:

CG524,

<i>Your solution is elegant and if I had a steady check coming in, I would relax and focus on other ventures (making more contributions to ATOM.)</i>

Yes!  That is exactly the idea.  Too many people assume the DUES will kill incentives, but I claim it will increase it, since the income tax is 0%, and the tailwind behind all technology startups would be higher.

I would also suggest Peter Diamandis, if you havent already contacted him. He is involved in everything to do with futurism and abundance. \

I'm trying to spread the idea amongst various libertarian minded people here in my country.

Interesting thread about UBI at Instapundit today:

Not a single mention about this concept over there- and remember these readers are a far above average slice of the internet.

Food for thought

peter Diamandis actually is favourable to the UBI idea. 

I have been hearing more and more about the general idea of UBI in the mainstream chatterings, however people seem stuck in the idea that taxation is needed to fund it. The DUES is much better .

Idiocrates,

Thanks.  The thing is, I am having trouble getting a fair hearing from Singularity U, despite my material being more advanced than most of theirs.  I will get there, but at the moment they seem long on steep fees and light on new ideas..

A less than ideal place to post/contactmay be here? They have a forum, and so may expose the ATOM to multiple eyeballs.

Kartik,
What's the latest with the video competition?
It seems to me that a better approach might be to employ your own advice to individuals (such as here: <a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/11-implementation-of-the-atom-age-for-individuals.html">http://atom.singularity2050.com/11-implementation-of-the-atom-age-for-individuals.html</a> ) and crowdfund/kickstart it yourself, no?

James Deus,

It will be unveiled shortly.  

Crowdfunding is one avenue I may pursue, but it is extremely difficult to generate money for a prize via crowdfunding.

Kartik, I appreciate the ideas you present and they make sense to me. I see the effects of technological deflation. However, there may be a flaw, Moore's law (which the ATOM theory relies on) is said to be coming to an absolute stop. what are your thoughts on this?

RB,

This is explained in detail throughout the publication.  Plus, it is inaccurate to assume that Moore's Law is the entirely of technological progress, or even the entirety of computing.  For example, parallel computing processes neural nets 20-50x faster than serial computing, even if the transistors are of the same size under Moore's Law.  

You have observed how storage costs have fallen for decades.  That is not Moore's Law.  Hence it is incorrect to think of Moore's Law being the entirely of technological progress (or even a large part of it).  It is not.

Hello Dearth,

There is an ebook format (and hardcopy) for sale on Amazon, but the v2.0 is not published there yet.

But this website and the .pdf format are free.

Hello ~
I've been lurking for a long time, watching your blog, and now your youtube channel.
Thank you for creating both information sites, very informative.
Two requests ~
1)Could you please create a bitchute channel as well? Bitchute will increase your reach, as well as being a backup in case Youtube goes down.
2)Please, please would you make a vid about this Zerohedge article:

<a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/fed-prepares-go-direct-liquidity">https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/fed-prepares-go-direct-liquidity</a>

I tried to understand it, but it was all gibberish to me, so...?
Just confused as to what it says or means, or is it just another handwaving bit of 'magic' that Phd's tend to do?
Thank you again for your insights, they help during these times of turmoil,
Linnea

Hello Linnea,

Thanks for reading/watching.

I will look into Bitchute.  I haven't familiarized myself with it yet.  

I will do a video on what the Fed is doing.

<header class="entry-header">
<h1 class="entry-title" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></h1>
</header>
<div class="entry-content">
<p>This section of FAQs compiles the answers to these questions that are already in other chapters, into a resource for quick reference. &nbsp;More questions and answers will be added as patterns of repetition emerge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What qualifies you to come up with an idea that the established experts have not come up with?</strong></p>
<p>Some would say 25 years of career experience across technology and finance is a sufficient qualification by itself, but I do not, for there are thousands of people worldwide with comparable resumes. &nbsp;Instead, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/technology/">my 14 years of successful predictions at The Futurist</a></span>, and proprietary research into this subject is where the intricate connections between seemingly unrelated topics began to emerge.</p>
<p>One truth of the Third Millennium Economics is that a ‘credentialed’ person is no longer the authority on his subject, as the Internet always contains more knowledge than any one person can have. &nbsp;Furthermore, orthodoxy creates blindspots, within which a disruptor can operate unnoticed until the disruption is already underway.</p>
<p>Refer to every prior instance of a major disruption to an established order. &nbsp;The disruption always originated from the outside, and from someone who was not shackled by existing assumptions of ‘what cannot be done’, particularly when what may have been impossible at a certain technological level often does become possible with further technological improvements.</p>
<p>Most great innovations have been by outsiders undeterred by the ‘conventional wisdom’ of that particular moment. &nbsp;I am quite certain that policies similar to my ideas will be the norm in some major nations by 2025.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why is it called ‘Third Millennium Economics’?</strong></p>
<p>Many of the assumptions in traditional economics textbooks were inherent to the second millennium.&nbsp; Products involved complicated supply chain and transportation networks, and this led to factors like inventory management, etc. being significant determinants of economic conditions. This created conditions where increasing the money supply caused inflation.&nbsp; The lower prosperity of the second millennium also led to assumptions that most people had no discretionary spending and thus spent all of their income.&nbsp; Furthermore, the minimum viable size of a profitable business was much larger, due to fewer tools and lower economic complexity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in the third millennium, the accelerating rate of change has reached a gradient of steep progress where dematerialized products are becoming an ever-rising share of the economy.&nbsp; Since such products have almost no variable cost of production, and have infinite supply, they can cater to infinite demand without shortages, and have no inventory or shipping constraints.&nbsp; As these products can advance at faster rates than older types of products, and are converging to an ever-rising share of the economy, a whole host of macroeconomic assumptions have to be modernized.&nbsp; This includes a revision of government to implement automation, thus greatly reducing the cost of government, and funding this cost from the monetization of the output of automation, rather than the taxation of human output.&nbsp; These new principles are going to be the foundation of Third Millennium Economics.&nbsp; Formal economics as taught in universities, and as drawn upon to guide government decisions, is outdated, and the breakage this is causing in our existing system is evident.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hasn't money-printing caused a lot of inflation in other countries in the past?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>While there have been examples of money-printing causing high inflation, those instances were in a time where the percentage of world GDP comprised of technology was far lower than now.&nbsp; Even in 2008, the technological component of the economy was too small to offset monetary creation.&nbsp; This is the primary reason formal economists are opposed to the Third Millennium Economics set of ideas, because they have studied these past examples, but do not understand the technological component as a new factor.&nbsp; Furthermore, the ATOM-DUES program calculates the appropriate amount of monetary creation on a monthly basis, rapidly adjusting for any ebbs and flows in inflation or deflation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many PhD Economists have studied past examples of how money-printing caused inflation in poor, low-tech countries (such as Weimar Germany and contemporary Venezuela), and so are trained to overlook the much more recent examples of high-tech economies with technology-derived deflation.&nbsp; All the examples they cite are from long before high technology was even 0.5% of the economy, let alone the solid 3% that it is in 2020.&nbsp; Remember that PhD Economists have predicted about 100 of the last zero bouts of inflation in the last 35 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why are formal Economists (with PhDs) hostile to this idea?&nbsp; Surely they know the most because of their credentials.</strong></p>
<p>If incumbents with a vested interest in the status quo were the ones who could originate paradigm-changing ideas, then Uber would have been founded by someone who ran the taxi medallion commission for the New York City municipal government, and Tesla would have been founded in Saudi Arabia.&nbsp; The truth is, the establishment in any industry or field has a vested interest in perpetuating the status quo, and little reason to innovate or even listen to any ideas outside of their miniscule, incestuous echo chamber.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there is another barrier in addition to the above.&nbsp; The Economics profession is almost entirely immersed in academia and closely associated organizations.&nbsp; Hence, it is exclusively populated by those who could excel within the narrow skillset required from academia, have never been outside of that since the age of 18, and thus have no inputs from people who make decisions of consequence in the real economy.&nbsp; Consider the following fact : innovative companies that produce a value-added product that sells in the free market have been started by Engineers, Doctors, Lawyers, Salespeople, ex-Military Officers, Finance professionals, college dropouts, and more, but <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span></em> by someone with a PhD in Economics.&nbsp; Even if we restrict the criterion to financial services or FinTech companies, this group has contributed no entrepreneurial value.&nbsp; This damning indictment is exceptionally revealing, and indicates that Economics has a more extreme 'egghead' component than any other field of consequence, and thus there is no field where the establishment is more out of touch with the effect of technology on their subject matter.&nbsp; Their utter lack of curiosity about why their predictions continue to be wrong compounds the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>See the two images below to grasp how while science and technology has the full 7-layer stack that translates basic research into consumer products, finance and economics has a huge vacuum in between, and hence the pure theoreticians are tapped as ‘experts’ when they are nothing of the sort.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has a vast herd of 600 Economics PhDs on its staff, yet was exposed as recently as mid-2019 for deciding that the <em>only</em> determinant they use on whether to tighten or loosen liquidity is the unemployment rate.&nbsp; No other metric, such as the CPI or yield curve, was even used.&nbsp; Even worse, they actually say things like <em>"too many people have jobs"</em>.&nbsp; Who speaks like that?&nbsp; Why do the taxpayers have to pay for 600 PhDs to tell them this sort of thing?&nbsp; Also, they brag about how they send four highly-paid PhDs to a pizza parlor to 'study' the effects of a $15/hr minimum wage law on their business.&nbsp; The owner of the pizza parlor told them that it was forcing him to raise the price of pizzas and pricing him out of the market.&nbsp; Hence, the four PhDs concluded their three-month study, with a finding that anyone who has ever run a pizza parlor, coffee shop, or barbershop could tell them.&nbsp; To have PhDs in Economics running a Central Bank is no better than expecting a business school professor with no corporate P&amp;L experience to step into a CEO role at a Fortune 500 company.&nbsp; As a further example, consider that most PhD Economists were full believers in 'peak oil', all the way until the price started to crash in 2014, but never admitted their error.&nbsp; They also never evaluated the reasons for their extreme inaccuracy in making predictions, and thus still make similar predictions about other shortages.&nbsp; Having predicted 100 of the last zero bouts of hyperinflation in the last 35 years, they have led us down a strange, winding path to a dark, ugly place, and still insist that they know what they are doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, if the Federal Reserve decided monetary policy based on 100 small business owners who just cast their votes once a week (i.e. none of them are full time on the taxpayer trough), we would have a far more durable and productive economy than with a Federal Reserve staffed by 600 full-time PhDs on the taxpayer payroll who just reinforce each others' outdated assumptions.&nbsp; Your own net worth could be twice what it is now.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why are productivity gains so sluggish? &nbsp;Is that not evidence of slowing technological change?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/4-the-overlooked-economics-of-technology.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 4 addresses this in detail</span>.</a> Technology leads to productivity gains, but with Nominal GDP (NGDP) so low, there is not enough of a tailwind in economic growth for technology startups to receive valuations as high as they might. &nbsp;Valuations for ambitious technology ventures are heavily dependent on the trajectory of the stock market, which depends on earnings growth, which is a function of NGDP, not 'Real' GDP. &nbsp;Hence, low NGDP indeed leads to less technological progress and thus lower productivity gains. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Technological progress may return to the trendline rate by forcing central banks to increase NGDP through more monetary creation, which may be forced via a major stock market correction and deep recession. &nbsp;To avert this crisis, policymakers must focus on elevating NGDP in the US from the current 3% back up to the 6-7% seen prior to 2006. &nbsp;The increase will not merely be comprised of inflation, but rather a rise in 'Real' GDP as well simply due to a restoration of the trendline rate of technological progress. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Isn't inflation always bad, and thus deflation always good?</strong></p>
<p>Economics is far more nuanced that that. &nbsp;First of all, if you have debt (such as a mortgage), inflation is your greatest friend, and deflation your greatest terror. &nbsp;If your income keeps up with inflation, then inflation is not a problem. &nbsp;But if you have no income and live on savings, then deflation is better for you. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Countries like the US have forced too many people into too many types of debt (mortgage, student loan, auto). &nbsp;Each debt payment may be fixed, which means the borrower's ability to service it with increasing ease depends on a rising income. &nbsp;Hence, inflation of 2-3% is better for the US economy than inflation of 0% or less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Even if commodity, and thus goods prices, are always pushed downwards by technology, what about the price of services?</strong></p>
<p>This is a complicated subject, since 'services' have a much higher wage component than goods.&nbsp; That said, see <a href="https://atom.singularity2050.com/4-the-overlooked-economics-of-technology.html">Chapter 4</a> about the impact of automation on wages, as well as Chapters 6-10 for the clash between technological disruption and income taxation (i.e income taxes on human output are a large part of what makes humans uncompetitive with AI).&nbsp; Nonetheless, wage-heavy, government-intertwined sectors such as education <a href="https://www.singularity2050.com/2020/08/atom-award-of-the-month-august-2020.html">are experiencing massive deflation from technological alternatives</a>, and the disruptors are making impressive money despite the low end-user cost of the new, high-tech alternatives.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>As always, the rate of productivity gains, and the scale of delivery, are determinants of services pricing, and technology can assist both of those factors.&nbsp; The decline of services pricing in the private sector will pressure governments to follow suit, no matter how unwilling they may be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why was March 15, 2020 the 'Netscape Moment' for Economics?</strong></p>
<p>In the midst of the stock market crash triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, the S&amp;P 500 declined over 40% in a matter of days.&nbsp; In past recessions, peak-to-trough durations were 30 months in 2000-02 and 18 months in 2007-09 respectively.&nbsp; Over here, it happened in mere days, forcing the Federal Reserve to abandon their outdated dogma about 'high inflation' that never seems to arise.&nbsp; They were forced to lower the Fed Funds rate from 1.5% to 0%, and authorize over $2 Trillion of new monetary creation.&nbsp; They simultaneously abandoned the practice of only buying Treasuries and MBSs, and moved closer towards a more diffuse, granular type of monetary transmission (albeit stopping short of the true necessity - sending money directly to people and in equal amounts irrespective of their past or present income).&nbsp; March 15, 2020 was the exact day on which most of these major actions were taken, and the European Central Bank joined in with $820 Billion of their own.&nbsp; These are actions that the hundreds of PhDs at the Federal Reserve would never have imagined they would undertake, just two weeks prior.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you recall the first Internet boom, the Initial Public Offering of Netscape on August 9, 1995 was not just highly successful on its first day, but it triggered a cascade effect of new Internet companies and an Internet boom 4.5 years long.&nbsp; Even after the boom ended, the speed of everything was faster due to the permanently higher trajectory the Internet placed the economy on.&nbsp; Hence, that was the original Netscape Moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>March 15, 2020 was a comparable day, for it was the exact day where outdated economic thinking was unceremoniously swept aside and replaced with Third Millennium Economics.&nbsp; 'Egghead' Economists in their ivory towers still don't realize it, but now the eventual normalization of Third Millennium Economics principles and policy retooling across the world is not merely inevitable, but it is not very far off.&nbsp; Hence, what the Internet did for commerce and communication shifted into a higher gear on August 9, 1995, and the same is about to happen for economics, specifically the economics of technology, through an analogous historical event.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Economic growth may have grown exponentially, but what if we have reached some fundamental limit at this point?</strong></p>
<p>Bottlenecks to economic progress are often attributed to factors such as finite natural resources, human intelligence limits, and political will. &nbsp;The first two of these three are not going to be obstructions, because of the rise of Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence is quickly subsuming many laborious tasks that humans used to do, generating the same output for far lower input. &nbsp;Furthermore, the rate at which AI improves is much faster than human learning, so that continues the matching acceleration of economic growth rates.</p>
<p>Regarding the third factor, that of political will, the Direct, Universal, Exponential Stipend (DUES) combined with an elimination of all income tax (and associated processing and disbursement wastage) will re-align incentive structures towards productivity and entrepreneurship, allowing technology to return to its trendline rate of progress, bringing economic growth with it.</p>
<p>It is possible, however, that once AI can advance entirely without any human assistance, technologies that increase human living standards may plateau. &nbsp;This is unlikely to happen before mid-century, and is a topic beyond the scope of this publication. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do technological disruptions in one area increase the strength of disruptions in other areas?</strong></p>
<p>Technology is about lowering costs of something that was too expensive, either through replacing or bypassing the existing obstacle. &nbsp;When technology succeeds in one area (such as lowering oil prices), the money saved by those who paid too much for oil instead creates new demand elsewhere, enlarging a previous market and attract more competition, and hence innovation to it. &nbsp;<a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/3-technological-disruption-is-pervasive-and-deepening.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is explained in Chapter 3</span></a><a href="https://atom.singularity2050.com/3-technological-disruption-is-pervasive-and-deepening/">.</a></p>
<p>It may appear that there is no connection between oil and natural gas fracking innovations in the central US, and an e-commerce revolution in India that modernized banking, retail supply chains, and high-speed Internet access, but the former was absolutely what accelerated the latter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Of the two ideas presented, is ATOM DUES better or is the Sovereign Venture Fund better?</strong></p>
<p>Both are vastly better than our current mid-20th century fiscal and monetary framework and pre-software assumptions.&nbsp; However, ATOM DUES is both the far more broad-based prosperity enhancer, as well as the one that will encounter the most resistance within policy circles, since it involves reworking the entire taxation and spending system.&nbsp; For this reason, the Sovereign Venture Fund, which can be done completely detached from taxes and spending, is the one more likely to be implemented first.&nbsp; Alas, the Sovereign Venture Fund is less able to deliver a permanent structural improvement to working-class people than ATOM DUES.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How on Earth can income taxes be gradually phased out under ATOM DUES?</strong></p>
<p>Consider the following three points.</p>
<ol>
<li>75% of all US Federal government spending (if you exclude deficit spending, it is 96% of all income taxes collected) comprises of payments to individuals.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/4-the-overlooked-economics-of-technology.html">Federal Reserve QE has to be permanent and rise exponentially.</a></span></li>
<li>The only way for this QE to be fully effective and enable technology to have enough fuel to progress at the trendline rate, is for these funds to be given directly to people.</li>
</ol>
<p>When these three points are combined, replacement of current spending with QE money becomes natural, and with it, the gradual cessation of income taxes to fund this government spending. &nbsp;The phase-out of taxes will provide an immense boost to economic growth, even though the safety net is far more robust than existing programs. &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/7-government-policies-must-adapt-and-quickly.html">Read Chapter 7 for full details.</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Isn’t the DUES just another ill-conceived ‘Universal Basic Income’ or ‘living wage’ scheme?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/7-government-policies-must-adapt-and-quickly.html">The DUES greatly transcends those </a><a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/7-government-policies-must-adapt-and-quickly.html">schemes</a><a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/7-government-policies-must-adapt-and-quickly.html"> and removes the primary negatives of those schemes</a></span>. &nbsp;First of all, those programs rely on increased taxes on productive work. &nbsp;By contrast, for the DUES to work, it has to be simultaneous with a phase-out of all income tax, so technology can generate enough productivity to allow a certain level of central bank money creation without inflation.&nbsp; Anyone who calls this 'socialism' has to explain how the Third Millennium Economics program can require 0% income taxes (and no increases in consumption/sales taxes), and still be 'socialism'.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, those schemes do not provide for rapid annual increases in their payouts, whereas the DUES is fused with the ATOM and enables annual increases of an estimated 16-24%/year. &nbsp;Other such programs have no provision for rapid annual increases.</p>
<p>Thirdly, those schemes are still seen as a form of welfare or anti-poverty program, whereas the DUES is a complete win-win for all levels of society, since it continues to reinforce the same technological progress that enables an increase in the DUES.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How is this different from Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)?</strong></p>
<p>Third Millennium Economics&nbsp;is vastly more advanced than MMT, since MMT is not really a new idea at all.&nbsp; The problems with MMT are two-fold.&nbsp; First, MMT does not account for technological deflation, so it cannot see that monetary creation by central banks will not cause inflation.&nbsp; Second, MMT does not include an awareness of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/12/are_you_acceler.html">Accelerating Rate of Change</a></span>, which leaves MMT ill-equipped to take advantage of the exponential progress of technology and its ever-rising proportion of the economy.&nbsp; Hence, MMT still comprises of just tinkering around the edges, and does not provide a substantial improvement to the human condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Won't the DUES program merely create a massive leisure class, with no incentive to produce?</strong></p>
<p>Definitely not, as explained in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/7-government-policies-must-adapt-and-quickly.html">Chapter 7</a></span>. &nbsp;The reasons for this are :</p>
<ol>
<li>The Federal income tax rate will be gradually reduced to 0%. &nbsp;This creates a huge increase in incentives relative to what exists today. &nbsp;The return on productivity is twice as much under a 0% tax rate as under a 50% tax rate.&nbsp; Many people will be thrilled to work harder than they are now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>The removal of the tax filing burden and a large portion of regulatory complexity creates a far more favorable climate for entrepreneurship.</li>
<li>A worry about a large leisure class is mutually exclusive with a worry about technological elimination of jobs, and with a worry about rising healthcare costs. &nbsp;For someone to worry the former implies they are no longer worried about the latter. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The range of professions that exist, and of talents that can be monetized, is ever-rising, as discussed in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/9-reframing-inequality-.html">Chapter 9</a></span>. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Moving from a dreary or humiliating job in an expensive area to a life of leisure in a low-cost area is hardly a bad thing, including for peripheral people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I don’t pay much in income taxes, so why should I be interested in a tax phase-out for the rich?</strong></p>
<p>You may not pay a lot in income taxes, but your first, second, and third level bosses certainly do, and this is money that instead might go towards giving you a raise. &nbsp;Your customers also pay income taxes, which prevents them from buying more of what you sell, instead of being mandated to 'buy' what the government sells. &nbsp;Plus, the hassle of filing and calculating one’s tax prevents employers from creating new jobs, as described in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/6-current-government-policy-will-soon-be-ineffective.html">Chapter 6</a></span>. &nbsp;If you are unemployed, and people who might hire you instead have to worry about taxes, then they are specifically sending to the government the funds that instead should be used to hire you.</p>
<p>Some argue that 'trickle-down' economics has not worked, but the truth is :</p>
<ol>
<li>'Tax cuts' are reductions in published rates, which do not affect the ultra-wealthy, as they have the means to avoid reporting income on their 1040s to begin with. &nbsp;An increase in income tax rates hits the upper middle class, not the ultrawealthy, as explained in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/6-current-government-policy-will-soon-be-ineffective.html">Chapter 6</a></span>. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Tax complexity remains the same after a reduction in a tax rate, and tax complexity is the biggest drag on this stimulus effect. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Nonetheless, when tax rates were lowered (such as in the early 1980s, in 2003, and in 2019), there was a sudden boost in economic activity.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why is an extremely complicated tax code bad, if I have Turbotax anyway?</strong></p>
<p>A complicated tax code has four primary problems :</p>
<ol>
<li>It is complex specifically to hide various loopholes designed to enable the ultrawealthy to avoid paying income tax or estate tax.&nbsp; There are so many loopholes that even tax lawyers don't know about all of them, but rather each specializes in just a small fraction of them.&nbsp; Many legislators can thus be bribed into creating a loophole for just one big donor.&nbsp; Add up over 100 loopholes, and the tax code becomes incomprehensible, contradictory, and impossible for the IRS to enforce fairly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>The cost of tax complexity costs over 20% of tax collected, and that is even before accounting for the even larger cost of suboptimal business decisions driven by tax reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>The loophole-utilization industry enriches a few elite tax lawyers and tax-haven countries.&nbsp; When you realize that there are over two dozen small countries that exist for the express purpose of capturing a cut of the net savings gained by an individual or corporation through the avoidance of US income tax, you realize how much in the way of time and resources are wasted in this bizarre process of pretending the entity pays more tax than it does.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Unfortunately, the ultrawealthy will never agree to paying income or estate tax, and the street-level socialist activists make no distinction between a surgeon and a billionaire in terms of the reviled 'wealthy' that they want to tax, and thus cannot grasp that raising the 'retail' tax rate does nothing to separate the ultrawealthy from their money, and in fact ensconces them deeper by chopping down the mere millionaires who might have been their competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>See <a href="https://atom.singularity2050.com/6-current-government-policy-will-soon-be-ineffective.html">Chapter 6</a> for more details.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Does this program correct the US National Debt?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it does. &nbsp;Under the ATOM DUES program, we could <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hypothetically</span> get to the point by as soon as 2025 where income tax has been phased out and all government spending is funded with Federal Reserve QE instead of taxation (most of it consolidated into a DUES). &nbsp;Hence, there is no spending in excess of taxes, which is where the annual budget deficit and resultant issuance of debt (US Treasuries) arises. &nbsp;For this reason, there is no new addition to the existing National Debt. &nbsp;</p>
<p>From here, we move on to the matter of the existing National Debt, which currently stands at about $23 Trillion and will continue to grow by the time the full transition to the ATOM DUES is phased in. &nbsp;As the existing Treasuries mature and expire, they will, for the first time, not be replaced by newly issued Treasuries since the US government is no longer issuing debt to finance a deficit. &nbsp;Hence, the existing pile of Treasuries will continually expire without replacement, ensuring that the existing bond holders see the debt instrument end after the expected duration even as the debt gradually shrinks. &nbsp;If there is full DUES implementation by 2025, the existing National Debt will shrink to a negligible portion of US GDP by 2035. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is the Upgrade Paradox?</strong></p>
<p>See the article <a href="https://www.singularity2050.com/2017/04/the-upgrade-paradox.html">here</a>.&nbsp; The technology industry is effectively a victim of its own success.&nbsp; There are too many products the average household now has to upgrade frequently, as the number of exponentially improving nodes per household is now in the dozens (see <a href="https://atom.singularity2050.com/3-technological-disruption-is-pervasive-and-deepening.html">Chapter 3</a>).&nbsp; Since people are expected to spend more and more to upgrade their entire family's PCs, smartphones, tablets, television screens, and even cars, but are not receiving any significant share of the gains made through technology, it is becoming too expensive to keep upgrading.&nbsp; This means that the speed of technology diffusion ironically slows.&nbsp; This is why a more direct and democratized monetization of diffuse technological progress is crucial, and ATOM-DUES enables technology to return to the long-term trendline of progress it has failed to keep up with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I am not a technology expert. &nbsp;How do I begin to improve my life and career through Third Millennium Economics?</strong></p>
<p>One does not need to be tech-savvy at all to become an expert ‘lifehacker’ through targeted Internet research. &nbsp;A number of people have already figured out the solution(s) to most of your challenges, and have posted the material online.</p>
<p>The best way to start is to think about all the challenges you have in life, and all the examples of how someone else managed to obtain what you want. &nbsp;Then, begin the metamorphosis into a search demon who reads as much as possible about how others achieved your goal. &nbsp;You will become better at searching once you practice search engine optimization, algorithmic AI, and speed reading. &nbsp;With more practice, you will know how to identify the right blogs, and the right people at message boards who have valuable information, and with your own rising ability to contribute information of value to others, some knowledge will find itself pulled towards you. &nbsp;The more of this you do, the better you become.</p>
<p>The other key component is confidence. &nbsp;Don’t assume that a highly credentialed doctor, lawyer, or financial advisor will always know more than you can mine from the web. &nbsp;See them as components of a solution; beacons to help point you in the right direction of discovery. &nbsp;In this age, knowledge is highly decentralized with ever-lowering barriers to access. &nbsp;This, not coincidentally, is why knowledge is expanding faster than before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What asset classes should one keep their money in, if they believe in the Third Millennium Economics thesis?</strong></p>
<p>Historically, people have assumed that gold is a hedge against inflation.&nbsp; While this may have been true prior to the modern era, today, that is one of the worst allocations a person can make.&nbsp; To believe that gold is going to be the beneficiary of permanent monetary creation is to have no understanding of technology.&nbsp; For one thing, technology will rapidly increase the supply of gold if the price rises to a point where this is economical (as happened with oil).&nbsp; Secondly, gold is an inert commodity that has little practical, essential use in the economy (people need oil to get to and from work, but there is almost no one who cannot survive for four days without gold).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>By contrast, technology equities are the biggest beneficiaries of Third Millennium Economics.&nbsp; A simple observation of the price change in gold vs. in the Nasdaq 100, since QE began, reveals the essence of Third Millennium Economics truths.&nbsp; Even in just the five years before the v2.0 release of this publication (i.e. from May 31, 2015 to May 31, 2020), the huge divergence in the trajectory of gold relative to the Nasdaq 100 is evident.&nbsp; This divergence will continue, as per the foundational ATOM principles.&nbsp; Note that this refers to a broad index of technology companies, such as the Nasdaq 100, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> any individual company's stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Why does the QE from one country flow to another country?
And how do you avoid a competition where every country is printing more than enough?

Hello Jenny,

<i>Why does the QE from one country flow to another country?</i>

Because technology is borderless.  It is just like sending an email with an attachment to a multiple recipients in multiple countries.

<i>And how do you avoid a competition where every country is printing more than enough?</i>

That would be a good problem to have relative to where the world is now, but the answer is that at that point, some allocation agreement across major economies will have to be reached.

<li>Viral marketing through social media. Whether Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, or anywhere else, post this wherever you feel it may be appropriate (such as retweeting my ‘ATOM Award of the Week’).</li>
<li>Help me build exposure by connecting with, and present this material to, key figures in the mainstream media, who can then bring this to a broader audience.</li>
<li>Following some media exposure, the next step is to present to central banks, elected officials, and thought leaders. If you have a suitable contact, help arrange a meeting or phonecall where I can present these ideas to them.</li>

I have just read the whole thing, and even having religiously digested your earlier works on "the Futurist", I am astounded. It will take many rereads to truly grasp what you are driving at, but I have already shared  amongst my social network. I will do what I can to spread these ideas.

How would you consider Ireland as a possible ATOM start point, given its a vibrant fairly free market, pro business economy with a lot of IT investment? Irish politics is a dumpster fire of populist nonsense though, so maybe not.

Thanks, Stephen.  We are not the establishment, but spreading the ideas will eventually enable us to get the policies debated in the highest tiers of government.  

Ireland has a high technology density and low taxes, BUT,...

....it uses the Euro, and hence can only do an ATOM-derived DUES program when the entire Eurozone does it.  All countries using the Euro are under the European Central Bank.  The ECB does generate 80B Euros/month at present, but that is not enough, and they are nowhere near thinking about monetizing government spending.  

That is the primary disadvantage Ireland has relative to Switzerland.  The Eurozone itself will migrate only after a country like Switzerland demonstrates success.  Britain is now a candidate to do it as well, as it is free of the entire EU (and was never in the Eurozone).

One suggestion: It would be good and helpful to have one or more policy recommendation documents available as resources here. Concise, formatted with standard policy recommendation templates, arguing the key salient points, and with links back to here and other resources as necessary. Even a Google Doc or Wiki that could be copied and edited / improved by the community over time.

Good idea.  I will have to see how to set that up, and hopefully the community can manage it over time.  

If someone has more direct expertise in setting that up, that would get it done sooner.

M. Simon,

Thanks for that.  I knew I could count on you.  

We have to keep inching ahead.  The DUES combined with 0% income tax will correct layer upon layer of problems.  

Note that men and women get the same DUES, and every child upon turning 18 does as well.  The DUES cannot be garnished by anyone, so replaces alimony, CS, wage garnishment, etc. and all associated bureaucracies.  It disincentivizes single motherhood since a childless woman vs. single mother get the same DUES (unlike now).

Congratulations Kartik on reaching the enlightenment plateau.  It is rare that people can come to these conclusions by themselves and not succumb to the myriad propaganda offering fail-able solutions.  I think your end solution is a pretty good one that has numerous points of merit.  I especially like the new (to me) assessment of real vs. nominal GDP.  It fits very well.  My only serious issue is that it still relies on government (elite controlled) action by both self serving politicians and far more self serving central bankers.  After coming to that realization and seeing the massive delay overcoming that would incur, I hunted down an even better solution.

As you might imagine, it's far too complex in its entirety to go into here but some high points follow to begin the discussion.  And just for disclosure, I'm a fully ATOM based person, creating the first in a long string of technologies that accelerate the trendline not only back to the norm but onto a high trajectory.

The solution I propose centers around a digital currency (I'll use Bitcoin for simple reference but it could be another existing or new one.)  If the Bitcoin community agreed to implement an additional transaction fee on every transaction of 1%, regardless of who/what the transfer was for, and put that into a single account.  Then daily, that account was distributed equally to every member whom signed up for the free dividend, it would quickly become self propagating into the benefits you cite in your program.  Obviously, some rules need to be created to manage such a system but they could all be done autonomously, ensuring that admin costs remain marginally zero.

By replacing one's transactions in fiat with digital, one loses all the taxes paid via the fiat (mostly commerce and business and eventually credit creation) and replaces them with a simple method (Bitcoin transactions are/will be insanely easy) that is taxed a mere 1%.  Combine this with the spending power of those receiving the dividend and you get an attraction of not only the intra Bitcoin transactions but also the investment of fiat money to fund new Bitcoin ventures.

The 'monetary expansion' phase would be derived from the increased wealth created in Bitcoin as people migrate more of their commerce to it and it's value increases.  It would be instantly global in scope, moving the world's poorest up first and then attacking poverty on each successive level.  It carries many of the same benefits of increasing commerce and economic activity and even advancing the ATOM principles of that community as it grew.  However, as it attracted business activity, it would do so at the expense of the fiat currencies those businesses used to work in.  This has the effect of increasing the Bitcoin money supply (the value, not the nominal units) even more than your 20% requirement.  It would increase more by the amount it robbed from the fiat currency as well.  This automatic process would not rely on policy but would be market driven and autonomous.  Even autonomous transactions (e.g. micro-payments between robots, per click charges) and personal/black market transactions would be captured as long as they were done in the instant digital world.  The list of benefits is nearly endless but at your caliber, I suspect you need no list.  Most relevant to this discussion is that services would either not be needed anymore or would in large part, be offered via the free market.  While this doesn't automatically reduce government spending, it certainly removes most of the justification (and budget) for many aid programs.  Ideally, this reduction would be in sync with the reduced tax revenue so governments could maintain balanced budgets while they fell dramatically.  And yes, this would even include war budgets.

On the logistical side, the implementation can be done in such a way as to create even more societal benefits rather than act as a cost.  In my proposal, I outline a system of unique account verification where DNA scanners could be used and where the incentive is for people to invest in many of them (lowering their cost from $1000 to $50 each) while earning an income by signing up new dividend account holders.  This would create a global, one-way anonymous database of DNA information that was immensely useful for the medical research community while allowing them to post meta-tags of relevant info anonymously back to the human whom it belongs to.  This can even migrated at some pre-determined future time to genome mapping for even greater benefit.

In the long term, I see the future of economics undergoing a paradigm shift and eliminating all the non-productive pieces.  This proposal seeks to accelerate those changes to bring about the end state much sooner.  For example, the entire purpose of the public stock market is allow some people to earn a living from the productive profits of a business simple because the market was not efficient enough for said business to capitalize their growth soon enough.  Making this money from trading robs that from the long term wages of both the labor and owner profits so eliminating it has the net effect of increasing the ATOM.  Tech deflation could ramp up by far more than your 16-24% estimate if it weren't for this theft.  As such, the end state (in a perfect world) would have a different mechanism to fund company growth at low or no cost and would allow the deflation to accelerate faster.  By transitioning a company's investor transactions to digital, numerous algorithm methods and efficiencies, coupled with instant competition, could reduce said costs.  The good part here is that practices like hedging, options and high frequency trading would not be practical if each separate transaction realized a 1% cost.  Therefore, the businesses would migrate to the digital side and leave the corruption behind them.  Win-win, for the company and society.  Not so much for the Wall St. clan.

The other aspect of the end state is that tech advancement has migrated us to what Jeremy Rifkin calls the zero marginal cost.  I believe this should have been a key piece in economics since it was created but we finally have the ability to incorporate it now.  There are now what I call "magic boxes" in every industry that will disrupt the wasteful aspects into purely productive aspects.  For me, a magic box for home energy is like a perfect solar system.  It would replace a long time rent (the monthly power bill) with a short term purchase, while satisfying all the needs relevant to said good or service.  My threshold is an 8 year pay off maximum and lasting a lifetime with minimal maintenance.  Also, to qualify as a magic box, it should be produced locally, use fully recyclable resources and be promoted via local awareness, not push-advertising.  Very few fully completed magic boxes are on the market but labs and garages do already have the rest in the works.  The only one I see as needing a boost for that time frame is fighting disease, hence the DNA database.  Feel free to contact me to debate any specific ones but for brevity, I can simply say that within 10 years and with a little luck, everything you can need or want can either be an owned or a shared magic box.  

As you can imagine, paying off one's lifetime worth of living expenses in a max of 8 years (an average of 6), reduces the real cost of living by 85% or more.  Adding back in the costs of emergencies, vacations and 'oh crap savings', brings it to around 80%.  This couples nicely with the reduced jobs that will be available, the increase in unemployment and happily, with the increase in personal spending power of the future.  The net effect is that working for a paycheck to make a living can migrate to doing a hobby/passion/mission for nothing more than the internal and/or external social sense of accomplishment.  In a word, money will be relegated to insignificance it will no longer be worth the hassle of managing it.

This will accelerate the ATOM transition far too fast for ANY policies to keep up.  That's the thing about exponential technologies that all feed into each other.  They don't go from 2% to 8% in 5 years and then to 20% in 5 more.  Their third number is pushing the 90% adoption curve barrier.  To be clear however, I see the ATOM progress and the growth of magic box disruptions as unstoppable so our efforts really only amount to easing pain during the transition.

In short, we simply don't have the time to wait.  The only way I see things remaining even close to balanced is to jump straight to a private, global, instant, autonomous and market driven solution.

Have a look at my paper and let me know what you think.  You can find it on the usbig (.net) site under discussion papers <a href="http://usbig.net/papers.php">http://usbig.net/papers.php</a> .  I agree that this topic needs a champion but I also believe that only one proposal should be promoted so we should engage debate to find which one to promote first and then join forces down that path.  Being more focused on bringing some magic boxes to the people, I'm looking for that champion.

Hi Todd,

Thanks for reading the entire book and making such a detailed comment.  

<i>My only serious issue is that it still relies on government (elite controlled) action by both self serving politicians and far more self serving central bankers. </i>

Well.... Consider that :

a) Central banks become more important, but also more transparent.  They really have no micro-control other than publishing the monthly DUES increase rate.  The range of activities they conduct become simpler.

b) Similarly, note that the other parts of government slim down.  Entire departments like the IRS and SSA can be abolished.  The DUES requires almost no bureaucrats to administer, just the analytical team at the Federal Reserve that calculates the monthly increase.  Non-military Federal Government headcount can fall by 80% or more.  

<i>In the long term, I see the future of economics undergoing a paradigm shift and eliminating all the non-productive pieces.</i>

Indeed.  <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2014/07/the-education-disruption-2015.html">Read my piece on the education sector.</a>  The medical and government sectors are also overdue for this reform, which is unstoppable under ATOM principles.  

I will read your paper, and then we can discuss further.

Kartik,

Central banks have vastly more power than you seem to suggest.  They can manipulate markets, currency exchange rates, commodities, money swaps, trading platforms, influence bonds, and generally control entire industries indirectly.  This is due to the fact that the people in the central bank positions are the same people in the top mega banks.  One look at their history of criminal acts for which they repeatedly pay wrist-slap fines when caught, and it's undeniable how deep they are.  Some would even say they cause war to follow those countries that dare to threaten the dominance of a few (or single) fiat currency in global commerce.

With that in mind, you want to give them more power?  Transparency of people knowing they've been caught so many times has not stopped it, nor would it if the stakes were immensely higher.

So, your proposal leads to two possible outcomes.  First is they stop it from succeeding and second is they make things worse through the new changes.  And this is on top of us waiting years for our minuscule movements to grow into action.

Your item #2 assumes the second of those outcomes, which is now a negative, not a positive.

The root problem here is one of power.  They have it and the people don't.  But that statement relies heavily on its definition.  In all areas, power is derived from discretionary income - period.  It really is that simple.  

Without discretionary income, or spendable cash, a person has no voice in politics, social clout or market influence.  Acts exerting power like that will always be prioritized after surviving, climbing to or maintaining one's living standards.  This lack of power is often called apathy but that's incorrect.  They cite the definition of crazy (doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results) as their justification but in reality, they're correct.  Without the power, a few voices will never rally the masses to look beyond the continuum of false black and white choices they are presented with.  Those who sense this are hence labeled apathetic and presented as 'the other side' in every battle.

Unfortunately, the rentier society has succeeded in robbing all non-wealthy people to the point they'll compromise all their discretionary income plus a little more before they fight back.  So, by definition, they have no extra to wield any power.  

And this is exactly how the system is designed.  Corporations don't want people rising to boycott cell phone charges that are too high.  Politicians don't want people becoming active in voting groups.  Bankers don't want people to learn how to avoid bank fees, interest or mega-stock scams.  

To be clear, they're not actually plotting against these actions but more just chasing every profit path they can exploit.  The end result is the same.  And the follow on is that the people do not, will not and never will have any power to make the world what they want again... until they have the economic excess to spend on doing so.

You suggest I read your education piece.  While a bit old now, it is a prime example of a magic box disruption of an industry that's beyond its sell-by date.  As you can see above, I wrote that every industry (seriously, I can't think of one exception) is primed for that exact magic box disruption.  And most of them will happen faster due to the assistance of AI, robotics, self/local movements, climate fears, inequality fears, technological unemployment and other ATOM based changes.  In other words, you're preachin' to the choir.

Still looking forward to your take on my proposal.  Good day!

Todd,

The ATOM DUES program actually decreases central bank power from current levels while increasing transparency, despite the larger amount of monetary creation.  Central banks have no function other than the calculate the monthly increase and send out the direct deposits (1 payer to 220 million recipients).

Remember that the elimination of the IRS, SSA, Welfare administration, etc. is a massive reduction in government power, particularly of identity politics, politicized IRS audits,  perverse welfare incentives, etc.  The removal of this is more than worth the increase in central bank importance (which I still say is a reduction in power due to the very high transparency of the monthly DUES increment calculation).  

Getting a new currency like Bitcoin is too difficult, as the nation-states of the world will stop that (even with force) if it is a threat to their existing currency.  It is better to work within their currencies to create a DUES-type program of higher transparency.  The opposition will be much lower.  

<i>The other aspect of the end state is that tech advancement has migrated us to what Jeremy Rifkin calls the zero marginal cost. </i>

Yes.  This is why a DUES with a simultaneous phase-out of all income taxes is possible now.  It involves working with central banks, not against them (impossible at present).

Yes, there is disruption everywhere.  What you call magic boxes apply to any item which is too expensive.  And I mean *any* product or service, including what one human provides to another.  Note that within the ATOM, I contend that all disruptions are interconnected, and there is a measurable 'size' of disruptions happening at any given time, which is rising gradually and exponentially.  

Yes, I like your proposal, since there is only enough effort to promote one given our limited time and resources.

Kartik,
Thnx for the reply.
The benefits you cite from implementing ATOM DUES, while worthwhile, only arise after it is implemented.  Since powerful entities would lose considerable market power, they will stop this from happening, especially since they have the power to do so.  Unlike legislating changes, they have zero power to stop a crypto currency like Bitcoin.  They've already tried and failed.  Similarly, they could not stop said currency from distributing funds autonomously.  It's just not gonna happen that they can stop the millions of computers miners from earning money because the more they accomplish, the higher the incentive to hide it or go dark.

In regards to "working with their currencies", it would be very easy to divert a percentage of the daily dividend amount to the local governments under whose jurisdiction the transaction was initiated and completed.  In this way, those governments would get their tax money and would become hooked on said income.  This would end their incentive to kill the system.  The only problem there is creating an entirely autonomous system up front to determine what % to give them.

And finally, as you agree, "*any* product or service" can be disrupted.  That should not exclude money issues nor governance.

Todd McKissick,

It is much harder to get a cryptocurrency up to sufficient size (which still has not happened for Bitcoin after all these years), than to merely transition existing central bank action to DUES.  Remember that the currency of a major state does have a military behind it.  

Plus, the key for technology to accelerate back to the trendline rate is a) elimination of income tax, and b) increase of Nominal GDP.  Both are achieved under the ATOM-DUES.  

What you are proposing is much more antagonistic to existing powers than what I am proposing.  Remember, central banks are on my side...

I do feel that that ATOM program is more comprehensive, addressing a wider range of challenges while making fewer enemies.

Kartik,

There is no 'sufficient size' needed for the currency to begin at because it will grow (both in adoption and value) from the attraction of new 'free money' members.  This being digital, global and pseudo-anonymous, means it cannot be stopped.  If it remains small, it will only hold the commerce of its members and if it grows massively, it may be able to attract the activities of the central banks as well.  Either way, it works the same.  

This is not antagonistic.  It is neutral.  The only way it is antagonizing the central banks is if they are more controlling than they officially purport to be.  So, either they have your stated mandate and no ulterior motives - in which case they don't fight it, or they are more nefarious - and seek to stop the competition.  Either way, the massive control and theft they wield over the economy gets diminished.  And that is only a good thing because they literally are the biggest example of waste, fraud and abuse in the entire economy.  Only naivete would believe they are on our side.  They are only on their own side.

There is another way to accelerate back to the trendline.  We can foster private investment in disruptive technologies.  To do this, we can also decrease the costs of living (via those advancements) and leave the savings in the hands of the adopters of said tech.  Picture it this way, what would you spend your income on as your expenses ramped from current to 5% of current over the next 5 years?  You would first eliminate debt, then build savings and then invest in more tech to further reduce your COL.  By 5 year's time, you would be debt free, have sufficient savings and have enough investment income to retire and leave your job to the next person.

In short, the rigged game of government running the economy is just that.  It is being rigged for politicians, banks, big industry and empire building.  Its past time to disrupt that, piecemeal or in blocks, leaving only a productive economy where money has no other purpose than a medium of exchange and value placeholder.  Using it as a tool of oppression needs to cease.

Todd,

I agree with the latter 50% of your comment.  Disruptions create new wealth, but the QE in the form of a DUES can provide a cushioning affect for the human turbulence.  

Under the ATOM program here, the intrusiveness of the government is reduced greatly, since many, many departments are eliminated and income tax is 0%.  The Federal Reserve is more transparent as well, as it has to publish the monthly increase rate openly.  There is no scope for smoke and mirrors at all.

Hi Kartik,
Here's another project that is active in the arena of what you might call "individually applied ATOM": <a href="http://iamcicada.com/cicada-deep-dive/">http://iamcicada.com/cicada-deep-dive/</a>
If you read through, you'll discover reference to how a "UBI" is facilitated by the technology.
Have you come any ways along in realising how organic, bottom-up DUES/UBI might become manifest (such as through this, and other, blockchain-type projects) rather than only top-down from central banks/nation states?

Hi James,

Thanks for keeping the ATOM in mind.

I do thing central bank participation is crucial, since permanent QE has to be done anyway.  This, in turn, creates bottom-up value on account of 0% income tax, which boost entrepreneurship.  

I had a good 1-hour program on local TV recently, which will be posted here when it becomes available on YouTube.

Kartik,
There's a great deal to like in your plan - but it suffers from an inadequate understanding of computer technology.

The key element I believe you are missing is that there is NO job that cannot be automated today. Anything a human being can do - even academic research - can be done better by a self-learning software-controlled entity conducting experiments and collecting data worldwide from its interest set. You should find this obvious looking at whatever jobs you wish. What do they require? If you're objective, you'll see their primary requirements are memory and deductive reasoning - both of which computers have more than adequately demonstrated over the past 20 years. Whatever inductive input the work requires can be provided by ONE human complementing hundreds of robotic entities.

While there is NO question technologically that all jobs CAN be automated, to what extent they WILL be - and how rapidly - will be determined by economics. Wherever technology is able to provide better products/services at lower price, there are many businesses (and businesspeople - and entrepreneurs), worldwide, aggressively pursuing these opportunities (hence, the likelihood is sooner than later).

Until this prospect of mass unemployment is wholly accepted (which I don't see in your plan), no viable solution is possible.

Ed Zimmer,

<i>The key element I believe you are missing is that there is NO job that cannot be automated today. </i>

That is largely true in theory, but as you point out, this is a lengthy process, and new jobs are still created simultaneously.  There are 145M jobs in the US today + 6 million unfilled openings.  This 151M total is the highest ever number, despite all the automation and the skills mismatch that is leaving some people behind.  

<i>Until this prospect of mass unemployment is wholly accepted (which I don't see in your plan), no viable solution is possible.</i>

That is why there is DUES, to cushion the people who just cannot fill the new jobs.  Plus, the reduction of income taxes to 0% will create a vast number of new businesses as well.  Mass unemployment would not happen at all under my plan.  The soonest that the situation you describe could occur is the 2040s, by which time the DUES could easily be very high.

When the number of jobs in the US falls 10% below the all-time peak, then we can start to worry about that.  Until then, I say the rate of new creation still outpaces the rate of elimination, even if all jobs *in theory* can be automated.  The leisure class will not be more than 20% of the adult working-age population.

<i>this is a lengthy process, and new jobs are still created simultaneously</i>

This is a fallacy. You yourself extol the acceleration of technology - and I believe you've even underestimated it. If you were embedded in the worldwide entrepreneurial community (as I have been the past 50 years), you'd better see what I mean.  And it's not new JOBS that are/will be created - it's new entrepreneurs doing their own thing, having no need for employees.  (I believe your job numbers are a temporary blip and very misleading if you look closely at the actual "jobs" and where they're leading.  (Keep in mind that there is NO job that cannot be automated - and that's not theory - in each case, it's just a matter of whether it's financially worth the effort.)

You appear to be seeing technology as an economic sector that is becoming a new growth industry.  To me that's terribly short-sighted.  Rather the advancing technology is underlying ALL economic sectors, improving their products/services and lowering their costs.

Ed Zimmer,

<i>You yourself extol the acceleration of technology - and I believe you've even underestimated it. </i>

Then the DUES would rise even faster than the 16-24% annual rate I estimate.  The beauty of the DUES is that it adjusts dynamically as the rate of technological change adjusts.  

<i>And it's not new JOBS that are/will be created - it's new entrepreneurs doing their own thing, having no need for employees.</i>

Read Chapters 4 and 11.  

<i>Rather the advancing technology is underlying ALL economic sectors, improving their products/services and lowering their costs.</i>

This publication is entirely about that.  Have you read the whole thing?  That is literally the primary theme of the whole publication.  

*If* all jobs are at risk for automation, then the DUES solution is the best solution of all.  But we are a long way from that, since job reduction of a scale you mention is not yet underway in the slightest.  Like I said, when the jobs data is 10% lower than the peak, then we can begin to think that job elimination is now overtaking job creation.  Right now, it is too early to assume that will be the case.  If the job number is shaky, one can corroborate that with Personal Income, Consumer Confidence, Retail Sales, etc.    

Remember, overestimating the rate of technological change also happens (even if most people underestimate it).  Ray Kurzweil says the singularity is 2045, but I say it is not as soon; more like 2060-65.  

Anyway, my frequent articles about these subjects are on The Futurist, so it would be great to have you comment regularly there.

<div class="entry-content">
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>–&nbsp;</em>Plato</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>When a wise man points to the stars, an imbecile criticizes the finger.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>–&nbsp;</em>Confucius (modified)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This book is the culmination of years of observations in combination with some proprietary research across different fields.&nbsp; The process of shaping these ideas involved deep immersion on both ends of the political spectrum, as well as in many alternative ideologies across fragmented parts of the Internet.&nbsp; I have had to adopt various online personas and wade through swamps of fanatics and mentally ill people, pretending for years to have views that I actually do not hold in real life, to find the occasional genius who delivers one profound sentence after another.&nbsp; Then the same had to be done in the opposing ideological camp.&nbsp; The process of creating transformative new knowledge is a messy one, full of many dead ends, distractions, and dances with lunatics.&nbsp; From this process, I hope this research has given rise to material that starts a trickle that grows into a stream, and later into a mighty river.</p>
<p>I do not claim to have all of the answers, but if some of these ideas are refined and implemented, we will make it easier for trends to return to established trajectories.&nbsp; This may permit us to enter a new age of abundance and upliftment and avoid at least one massive fiscal crisis and deflationary depression.&nbsp; A lot of material has been covered and it may be a challenge to retain the holistic case in the first read, but if I were to summarize the most crucial themes and ideas into a condensed list, it would be :</p>
<ul>
<li>The accelerating rate of technological change, while previously a topic of interest only to futurists and related technophiles, is now at a stage where insufficient awareness has tangible costs to individuals.</li>
<li>Economic growth, which has always been closely pegged to technological progress, has similarly been accelerating through centuries of data, and we are now entering a steep trajectory for the trendline, indeed the ‘knee of the curve’.</li>
<li>The world economy has been underperforming for years, with growth rates continuing to register well below the aforementioned trendline rates. This is due to the silent suppressive effect of some outdated policies and macroeconomic assumptions.</li>
<li>Technological deflation, while easily accepted when one is a shopper for a new computer, is almost entirely ignored by macroeconomists, even as effects of this deflation on economic data are pervasive and rising.</li>
<li>Technological disruptions across disparate areas are all interconnected with each other, and mutually reinforcing. There is a fixed but rising amount of aggregate disruption that is underway at any given time, in accordance with the accelerating rate of technological change.&nbsp; These first five bullet points effectively describe what we define as the ‘ATOM’.</li>
<li>Monetary expansion by central banks has served to merely offset the accelerating deflation that technology is generating across the economy. This deflation is international in nature, and so is most monetary expansion, no matter which country originates a particular expansion program.</li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be able to move many types of productive output into tax-free locations, eroding the tax base of high-tax locations. The borderless and untaxable nature of AI will effectively tighten the screws on nations and jurisdictions that tax productive output excessively.</li>
<li>Excessive fear of inflation, and assuming that even 3% inflation is high, has led to a chronic decline in the growth rate of Nominal GDP. This is a source of many types of malaise in the economies of wealthy countries that ‘Real’ GDP will not detect, and is constricting the rate of technological progress and productivity gains.</li>
<li>The ATOM will react to ensure technological progress reverts to the trendline rate, bypassing or toppling obstacles such as inadequate fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies in the process. This will begin to happen in the 2020s, and may accelerate after that point at a speed far too rapid for many governments to react to.</li>
<li>Barring the preemptive adoption of the technology-friendly monetary policies recommended here, another major financial crisis and deep recession remains an ongoing risk. Existing methods of monetary expansion will prove ineffective due to saturation of the inefficient methods used by central banks to date.&nbsp; In reality, the solution to the problem is elegant, simple, and ushers in a new era of rapid growth.</li>
<li>Central bank monetary expansion has to be made permanent as a policy, and openly declared as such. There can no longer be one-off programs tied to an assumption that each one is the final round of Quantitative Easing.&nbsp; Assets stored on central bank balance sheets can never be sold back into the market, so the balance sheets themselves are moot.</li>
<li>Western central bankers have been taught very outdated principles regarding the risk of inflation from monetary creation, rendering them virtually incapable of seeing these truths, even as they are evident to the technology industry, small business owners, and more.&nbsp; Hence, the fact that $23 Trillion of cumulative monetary creation since 2009 has not caused inflation is still a complete mystery to Economists with formal credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Monetary expansion has to be of a direct, diffuse nature. Current methods of bond-buying used by the US Federal Reserve are well into the point of diminishing returns, and end up concentrating the QE in very few hands.&nbsp; The only real discussion and analysis should be about the rate of annual increases.&nbsp; The US Federal Reserve has not yet been granted this power by the US Congress, which restricts the Fed’s ability to do what is necessary.</li>
<li>Monetary expansion has to rise at a compounded rate of 16-24% a year, possibly higher, to offset technological deflation and keep the Wu-Xia Shadow Rate in step with the size of the deflationary force. Current patterns of monetary expansion and the absence of inflation already supply the data to support this conclusion.</li>
<li>Since most government spending in the US and similarly advanced nations constitutes direct payments to individuals, these payments can and should be consolidated and formalized into a Direct Universal Exponential Stipend (DUES) that is paid equally to all citizens, and is funded by this central bank monetary expansion.</li>
<li>This DUES constitutes a dynamic and rapidly strengthening safety net, as well as a catalyst for entrepreneurship. Unlike negative interest rates, this does not punish savers, and is more scalable in accordance with accelerating technological deflation.</li>
<li>Federal income taxes can be phased out gradually and systematically, with all Federal government spending covered by monetary expansion, which itself is mostly the DUES.</li>
<li>This sort of reform taking current levels of technological progress and the associated deflation into account to create tax, monetary, and regulatory policies far more favorable to entrepreneurship transcends both socialism and capitalism. It is also the only way to harness disruptive technologies, such as AI, into a vehicle of broadly increased human prosperity.</li>
<li>Barring the first-choice avenue of ATOM DUES, the second-choice avenue of the Sovereign Venture Fund (SVF) is easier to implement politically, and still a huge improvement over the current status quo.&nbsp; The SVF carries a tremendous first-mover advantage, since a country can capture the entire world's technological deflation for domestic benefit as long as it is the first country to do so.&nbsp; The size of the SVF can be the same even if done by a relatively small country, hence delivering very high assets per capita.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>The US is not going to be the first nation to transition to such a new policy era, and certainly not before the next crisis. Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, and Switzerland are more suitable candidates to be the first countries to reform in favor of 21<sup>st</sup> century economic forces.</li>
<li>Few individuals, even if they work in the technology industry, have trained themselves to think like an active part of the ATOM. This mindset can be very profitable once adopted, and will become one of the core skillsets that an adult needs to have in order to prosper.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you read this entire publication, I thank you, and if some points are unclear, I urge you to read the text and view the associated video again.&nbsp; It is not easy to make what is essentially an economics textbook into something interesting.&nbsp; Given the urgent importance of getting these ideas to the people in power, I chose to post it online for free and add videos, rather than expand this to the length of a full book (or thrice again that length, like Thomas Piketty’s 700-page book) and market it as such.</p>
<p>I intend to devote a significant campaign towards bringing more exposure and debate to the ideas contained in this publication.&nbsp; I am embarking on this journey because I believe these concepts and policy recommendations can eventually benefit billions of people. &nbsp;When someone has the opportunity to make that sort of difference, it is their duty to devote a portion of their lives to such an endeavor.&nbsp; If you feel that some of these ideas have merit and should get in front of the right people, I invite you to join me and bring your talents to this campaign.</p>
<p>Our civilization has to upgrade to the next era.&nbsp; It is time.</p>

This is a pretty interesting analyses.  There does seem to be something distinctly different occurring economically right now - certainly the stimulus/response of the normal economy seems off somehow.  This is as good an explanation as any for what is happening.  However...

1) Unlike inflation, deflation is mathematically limited.  You can't deflate the prices of things below $0 for goods and services.  the store won't pay me to take their groceries.  In fact there will be some residual cost for everything, don't you think?  Which means endlessly inflating the money supply to compensate for the deflationary pressures of the ATOM won't work indefinitely.

2)  I have long thought of a slightly different approach to accomplishing the same thing.  Endowed government.  Here is how it would work.

Start with something easy, like higher education.  If a college had a large enough endowment, properly invested, it could pull 5% of that endowment each year to run the university. Harvard does that now.  In fact, if the endowment were large enough, the students wouldn't have to pay anything - they would get a free college education. The U.S. Federal government spends around $50 billion per year on supporting higher education, on a pay go basis.  What if that money went instead to beefing up endowments, in exchange for the universities agreeing to lower or eliminate all costs for students?  Start with universities that already have large endowments, and make them large enough to be self supporting indefinitely.  Now tax each student getting a "free" education $3,000 a year - and use that money for more endowments.

As such a system progresses, more and more collages would be essentially free, and more money would be available to endow even more colleges.  In 20-30 years every college in America would be free.  free forever.  This would have an enormous stimulatory effect on our economy.

But why stop there?  Move on to high schools.  Grade schools.  Trade schools.  each year, more and more of our education system would become financially self sustaining.  As the economy grows, so would the invested endowments. 

But why stop even there?  the same thing could be done to the medical system by endowing hospitals.  Retirement programs. Welfare.  Road building and maintenance.  Again as each segment of our government becomes fully funded by endowments, even more money is available to endow the next piece of government, and the next.

Eventually, most of what the government does is fully funded in perpetuity.  taxes could then fall steadily, and there would be little danger of budget overruns.

This is a round about way to accomplish the same thing you are saying - more and more "stimulus" is being added to the economy - costs to consumers are being reduced, budgets being balanced.  All the endowments would be invested in something - meaning there would be large amounts of money available for investment in economic expansion. So booming economy.

because the endowments are ever growing, they are not dependent on deflation due to the ATOM continuing forever.  In fact this program would have an accelerating effect on the ATOM - more and more capital would be seeking investments, with less and less costs to individuals.

Geoman,

There you are!  I have been waiting for your comments.  To your points :

1) Yes, deflation is limited, but the *room* it creates rises exponentially, so an ever-rising amount of monetary creation can continue.  This enables new business models to emerge, taking advantage of the now 'free' commodity.  There is always some residual cost to anything, but it vanishes into insignificance in many cases.  

2) The endowment model has many favorable traits, but :

a) it only benefits those who are suited for higher education in the first place, which, as we have seen, is only 15-20% of the US population.  You mention trade schools, but that only comes much later in the chain..
b) A lot of bureaucrats and other corrupt individuals draw salaries from the education industry, and these parasites will continue to thrive under the endowment model.  The same is true for healthcare.  The graftseekers are not cut off in this system.  
c) The elderly are only addressed long after the endowment model has spread past education.  In the ATOM DUES, Social Security is the first thing assimilated..

The benefit of the QE-derived stipend is that it is evenly distributed and replaces a lot of make-work graft jobs, so the most deprived areas (inner cities and depressed rural towns) get the most immediate jolt, with a rapid circulation of spending.  

But yes, the general idea is for taxes to be zero, all government spending be funded by the permanent, ever-rising QE that has to be done anyway, and a major simplification of bureaucracies, flow of funds, etc (which currently has a huge hidden cost at all levels of the economy).

You know I haven't read all sections here (there is a lot to digest), but there is an interesting economic model out there to look at.

The state of Alaska has a permanent fund - they took a percentage of the oil money and invested it.  Each year a portion of that investment is distributed to everyone in the state equally. It has a pretty statutory effect, especially the poor rural areas.  It is a bit like both ideas:  An endowment generating a small pseudo universal minimum income.

One other thing occurred to me, and that is the alternative to such a plan - immensely wealthy individuals controlling all the means of production, with a poor welfare based jobless underclass.  Change is coming, like it or not.

Maybe I'll try to post something in each section - this is a bit too big to piecemeal.

Geoman,

A college education is a waste. I became an aerospace engineer without one. In 1986. It is much easier these days.

Now what?

I share Geoman's concern about limited deflation with unlimited inflation. 

I understand the need for continual inflation to keep people and businesses from losing their shirts on their capital investments. I just wonder if there would be a better way say, for example, the federal government auctions off the 1/3 of the US land it currently owns and offers the proceeds as a one-time payment to those with capital investments to pay down the balance on those loans.

Also, one other need you say there is for the stipend is all the people technology will put out of work. I think that one of the things free market capitalism does best is to exploit resources, human or otherwise. The thing I like about this plan is that it seems to push government regulation and cronyism out of the way in favor of a free market in order to ensure continued upward prosperity. 

Anyway, I wish you good luck. I'm going to pass this around to some of my friends for their opinion.

Occam's Stubble,

Thanks.  I hope you read the whole thing, and feel free to comment on other chapters as well.  

Note that under the DUES program, the monthly adjustment is... monthly.  Most times it will be an increase, but if a brief period of staying flat or even (in theory) slightly decreasing is needed, that can be accommodated.  This is granular enough to take into account the ebbs and flows of technological waves.   

The thing is, a land sale is one-time.  We have to create an ongoing climate of higher NGDP within the context of technological deflation, so as to create a greater underpinning of tech startup valuation and exists, etc. as well as ensure that working class people have enough money with which to buy/upgrade their technology.  

Ultimately, one has to have faith in the existing body of evidence of technological deflation, and how that can indeed be a funnel of new monetization that increases prosperity.

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Astronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world to another.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>–&nbsp;</em>Plato</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07STWBXNoyg&amp;feature=youtu.be">(Video)</a></span>. &nbsp;Ultimately, the endgame of any treatise on future visions invariably marches toward one particular topic.&nbsp; We earlier examined how Third Millennium Economics was creating commercial activity in space for the first time, such as private spaceflight, asteroid mining, and zero-gravity 3D Printing.&nbsp; As sophisticated as this may seem, these are still just stepping stones to how the ATOM links our civilization to space.</p>
<p>When the space race was underway in the 1957-77 period and mankind made seemingly giant leaps, many enthusiasts extrapolated that rate of progress forward and predicted a substantial human presence in space by 2020.&nbsp; That has not happened, for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com/">there are presently only an exiguous number of people in space</a></span> (on average about one human out of every billion, at any given time).&nbsp; No humans have been more than a few hundred miles above the Earth’s surface in decades.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, assessments now veer towards the opposite extreme, with proclamations such as “Human civilization peaked in 1969-72 because we haven’t been on the Moon since then!” dominating the discourse.&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite to the contrary, the ATOM has enabled great strides in space exploration.&nbsp; This becomes apparent once one realizes that humans setting foot on an extraterrestrial surface is far from the only measure of progress. &nbsp;This is even despite the fact that landing a man on the Moon would cost far less, as a percentage of US GDP, than it did in 1969-72. &nbsp;The following content is a continuation of my article from 2009, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2009/05/seti-and-the-singularity.html">SETI and the Singularity</a></span>. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Space is For the Robots : &nbsp;</strong>For all the popular culture imagery around humans in space, such missions will never be as economical or efficient as sending advanced AI into the heavens.&nbsp; The overwhelming difference in space suitability between humans and AI can scarcely be exaggerated.</p>
<p>An AI does not require air or water, and can survive across a much wider range of temperatures, pressures, gravity, and radiation than a fragile human.&nbsp; An AI can load into a body or bodies (becoming a robot) as needed, or be stored in a tiny volume that is orders of magnitude smaller than what a human crew would require during space travel.&nbsp; The cost divergence begins at the time of launch itself, as it consumes far less fuel to launch a 100 kilogram piece of AI-installed hardware into space than a human-suitable spacecraft that may be 1 million times more massive.&nbsp; This hardware itself continues to shrink for each generation of Moore’s Law, while a ship designed to transport humans does not.&nbsp; Furthermore, if the spacecraft is destroyed in an accident, only the hardware has to be replaced, with the AI software loaded onto it.&nbsp; The tragic deaths and resultant delays associated with failed human missions become a non-issue.</p>
<p>The chasm widens further when one sees how few celestial destinations can host human life.&nbsp; In the entire Solar System there is no world aside from Earth where a human can remotely survive without an elaborate spacesuit, that too for just a short time.&nbsp; By contrast, every single solid world other than Mercury and Venus can host a suitable robotic lander or rover for years.&nbsp; Probes have even landed on comets despite their low gravity.&nbsp; Even with Mercury and Venus, orbital probes with sophisticated AI can operate for decades, and never have to be brought back to Earth.&nbsp; The AI can be endlessly upgraded from Earth via wireless transmission of software updates.&nbsp; Add all of these factors up, and the indisputable advantages in cost, durability, and versatility ensure that most scientific exploration of space will be done with AI housed in relatively small hardware.&nbsp; Each such probe or rover can transmit data back to Earth as well as to other AIs in other locations in space, creating an interplanetary network effect.&nbsp; A few humans may be sent up by their governments for political purposes, and brief recreational space trips for the ultra-wealthy may become a viable business, but that is about the extent of human space travel to occur over the medium term.&nbsp; The uncanny suitability of AI for space leads one to contemplate whether this is some pre-ordained grand design of which we are merely facilitators.</p>
<p>Instead, for the rest of the human population, the celestial will become the virtual.&nbsp; Images and videos beamed back to Earth by the AI will be incorporated into VR experiences, enabling humans to ‘walk’ on the surfaces of Mars, Europa, Callisto, and Titan from their own homes, or even ‘fly’ between worlds faster than the speed of light.&nbsp; More people will be able to experience space with considerable realism, even as real exploration advances without human presence in space.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Exponential Exploration and Discovery : &nbsp;</strong>If humans are to be Earthbound for a long time to come, that does not mean we miss the chance to revel in the growing wave of discoveries.&nbsp; Space exploration, particularly telescope power and data crunching, is being pulled into the ATOM, with the expected rate of exponential progress that entails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter what, the greatest question of all is whether we are alone in the universe, and if we are not, what form has that other life taken.&nbsp; As our technology has advanced, some of the assumptions around this question have begun to shift.&nbsp; This is a vast subject and cannot be done full justice here, but one trend that stands out is the rising power and precision of telescopic methods and their merger with big data and supercomputing.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2006/09/telescope_power.html">Back in 2006, I estimated that telescopic power is rising at a compounded rate of 26%/year (the square root of Moore's Law, as pixel count increases as a square of the shrinkage of the side dimension)</a></span>. &nbsp;This has, among other discoveries, resulted in the detection of planets outside of our solar system, known as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet">exoplanets</a></span>.</p>
<p>Most stars are too inherently dim to be seen from Earth, unless they are very near (the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, is nonetheless far below the brightness threshold where it might be seen with the naked eye).&nbsp; Since many of the dimmer, cooler stars have planets, and planets only reflect some miniscule fraction of the light they receive from their primary star, a planet within a star system several light years away is vanishingly faint when viewed from Earth.&nbsp; Such planets were impossible to detect until new methods independent of luminosity emerged, such as observing radial velocity and transits of the planet in front of its primary star.&nbsp; Astronomers have continued to refine these methods, and with the technological improvement of their instruments both on the ground and in space, the rate of exoplanet discovery is rising exponentially.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a4dd0832200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20240a4dd0832200d img-responsive" alt="Exoplanet_cumulative" title="Exoplanet_cumulative" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a4dd0832200d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a>As recently as 1995, there were hardly any exoplanets identified, but as the chart of annual discoveries shows us, we are now discovering an increasing number of them, in a curve that fits the familiar parabolic trajectory.&nbsp; There are now over 4000 planets confirmed, and the next 4000 will naturally take far less time than the first 4000.&nbsp; Note that newer methods are now generating the most detections (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet">chart from Wikipedia</a></span>).</p>
<p>The majority of early detections were larger, Jupiter-sized planets, and the discovery of Earth-sized planets has only begun more recently.&nbsp; Whether other forms of life require conditions similar to ours remains to be seen, but it is probable that any biological life forms may be just as unsuitable for space as we are.&nbsp; Nonetheless, if a small fraction of worlds with life have reached the threshold of creating their own artificial intelligence, their intelligence is similarly freed of conditional restrictions as ours would be, and then they might be easier to detect or even meet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the paradox of this means that under the accelerating rate of change, it is very hard for a civilization even slightly more advanced than us to avoid detection, due to the much greater presence and detectability it would have.&nbsp; This may explain the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi Paradox</a></span>, and increase the chances that we are one of very few advanced civilizations, or at least one of the earliest, and at least in our own galaxy.&nbsp; Over time, the exponentially rising rate of discovery will enable us to narrow down the range of probabilities of extra-terrestrial life and intelligence, and there will be orders of magnitude more candidate planets as soon as the 2020s. &nbsp;For a detailed article about how the ATOM affects SETI and the Drake Equation, and how there is a good chance that we are the most advanced civilization in at least this portion of the galaxy, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2009/05/seti-and-the-singularity.html">see my 2009 article</a></span>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>As we can see, the majority of future space activity does not involve manned space missions.&nbsp; In contrast, with the ATOM converging discovery technologies into a rapid rate of improvement, astronomical research has become an information technology.&nbsp; This dichotomy does not fit into old assumptions about how space might be explored, but there has never been a better time to be a space enthusiast, whether scientific, industrial, or philosophical.&nbsp; This is a statement that can only become increasingly true each passing year.</p>

I think this section could be beefed up.

Ultimately the cost for anything will boil down to three things 1) the cost of labor to make it 2) the cost of the materials to make it 3) the cost of the energy to make it.

With AI and robotics, cost #1 goes down to a very low number indeed.  With nanotech and 3d printing, the cost for #2 is also falling.  And with solar power, the cost for #3 is falling.  As each of these costs fall, they feed into declines in the other sectors, for example, robotics makes manufacturing solar cells cheaper, which makes energy cheaper.  

In space, there is the potential for an order of magnitude drop in energy and materials costs.  Solar energy is plentiful, and twice as strong as on the surface of the Earth.  Many rare elements, such as gold and platinum, occur in great abundance. What has always prevented exploitation of these resources is the lack of AI - putting people in space to control the process was always a very expensive proposition.  Having a robot do it...well, it pretty much removes the last obstacle.  

There are now two companies that plan to mine asteroids.  Looking over their plans...it could work.  seriously, for a reasonable and finite investment, they might just be able to conduct mining.

what if gold or palladium became available at a few buck a kg?  Wouldn't that spur all sorts of technological advancements that have be stifled due to the price of these materials?

AI and space has the potential to cut the costs of elements and energy to fractions of what we see right now.  What if the U.S. simply mined enough gold in place to put the U.S. back on the gold standard?  Oh yeah, and pay off the national debt.  In gold.  The extreme economic changes that could result from such a situation are hard to imagine.

The most valuable substance to be mined off planet will be water ice.  Given any sort of a power source, water ice becomes propellant, atmosphere, growing medium and radiation shielding.  The cool thing is that the farther from the sun you get, the more you find.  Even Mars gets wetter the more you look at it, though the water is generally tied up as water ice.  The solar system even delivers substantial icy bodies into the inner solar system via the earth orbit crossing asteroids and comets.  Fully half of the earth crossing asteroids are thought to be inactive comets with substantial percentages of water and other ices.  Some of them are very close to earth orbit in terms of delta-v for a trip, though the trip times will be long.  Enabling technology for this would be reactor(s) of some sort for power / propulsion (think the old Nerva as an example).  I came across a guy who worked with Gene Shoemaker who worked out how low temperature nuclear powered steam rockets will open the solar system pretty quickly.  URLs available upon request.   Cheers -

Agimarc,

You are correct about water, *if* humans are to be in space.  

However, I believe that AI will be what is sent into space, so water stops being crucial for the support of intelligence travelling across space.

Correct that water would not be required for maintenance of a human crew.  OTOH, it would still be needed for propulsion.  

Your idea of sending AI echoes a Freeman Dyson proposal a few decades ago to send large numbers of very smart, very small spacecraft for probes.  He called them space chickens if I recall properly.

Don't disagree that AI will do a lot of the heavy lifting / traveling / operating in space.  In the absence of a Singularity where we merge with our tech, there will still be a finite percentage of the general population that will want to travel into space and to other places.  And they will figure out how to do it.  We only need about 20k of them off planet for a robust breeding population.  I think that number is easily reachable, perhaps even with current tech.  Note that I chose 20k as the estimated human population following the Toba eruption some 70k years ago.

We are already seeing the marketplace start cutting orders of magnitude off the lift cost.  Compare what SpaceX is charging today per pound vs what shuttle was.  And this has only been going on for a short time.  I think you see a similar exponential decrease in the cost of launching and flying now that the marketplace has kicked in a bit.  Cheers -

agimarc,

Perhaps.  But since sending humans into space will never be cost-effective, it may not happen for humans in their current form.  

Even if humans do manage to self-finance, I wonder if the selection of the 20K will be marred by a paralyzing degree of 'political correctness'.  For one thing, it is logical that women outnumber men in the initial population, just for reproductive efficiency.  Gender will balance out within a generation.

My guess is that those who want to go are not particularly pc.  I think they will self-select and go on one way trips, perhaps in family units not unlike New World settlers did half a millennia ago.  And it won't be the governments that do the deed.

One way trips are currently technically feasible, as most of the cost is associated with bringing the crew back.  

Someone did an analysis of the actual costs for a person / family to reach the New World and compared it to the wealth of western families today.  As I remember the piece, those numbers are very close.  And your DUES / ATOM will make it even closer.  

Locations?  Mars is obvious.  So is the south pole of the moon.  Not so obvious would be various earth orbit crossing bodies - think of them as truck stops, various large asteroids,  perhaps the Jupiter Trojans.

If we start seeing reactors being developed for power and propulsion, this takes off pretty quickly.  Cheers -

We will colonize the moon and mars soon.  Within the next decade.

Magellan's crew circumnavigated the globe 1522. It took 4 years. The second circumnavigation was....Drake in 1580.  55 years later. It also took 4 years. The third circumnavigation was 1584.  Four years after the second. 4 years to complete.  The forth was 1588.  Four years.  But completed one year faster. The fifth was One year later.  The sixth was in 1590.  One year later.  By that point we stopped counting individual circumnavigations because they became so common.

Now the international space station circles the globe every 92 minutes.

Our last landing on the moon was 1972.  48 years ago.  Anyone think we won't land on the moon again in the next 7 years?  And that once we do, we won't land again every few years?

SpaceX is saying their entire star ship rocket program, with a flight around the moon and/or landing, will cost around $10 billion to develop and first launch.  Apollo's cost was...$152 billion in today's dollars. 1/15th the cost.

The cost to put a man on the moon per person was $12.6 billion.  And the deaths of three astronaut, and near deaths of three more.  Companies are now saying they can land people on the moon for <$750 million per person. Again, right around 1/15th the cost.

In 2019 dollars, U.S. GDP was $5.4 trillion in 1972.  Today it is $20 trillion. We have 4 times more money to pay 1/15th the cost for a lunar landing. And the economy is still growing, and the lunar landing costs are still declining.

We will land on the moon and mars soon, because the costs to do so will become trivial expenditures.

Geoman,

I am not so sure that the decline in launch costs will lead to more humans in space.

While there has been a 15x cost improvement in launching humans, the improvement in AI has been 10,000X during the same time.  AI, hence, is still far cheaper than a human in space, for any exploratory or research purpose.  The trendline you describe might in fact continue via unmanned, rather than manned, missions.  

Given the small size of AI, thousands of AIs in small, smartphone-sized hardware units can be launched in all directions (as against the one-ton crafts like Voyager I &2, etc.).  

Humans in space for recreation is still the only market.  But I still say that a time when thousands of people are at least as far away as the Moon, and remain so on a long-term basis, is very, very far away, if it ever happens at all.

Well, we could send robots to Antarctica, and Fiji.  Problem is loads of people want to visit those places in person.  

Traffic on Everest gets worse every year.  

You're saying since it is easier for us to look at pictures of Disneyland, there is no reason to go.

These won't be exploratory trips any more than a cruise around the world is a exploration.  This is going to be tourism. This is going to be colonization. 

In fact the robots will go first, build the base, then the humans will show up in their khakis toting folding chairs. We'll do it because why the hell not do it?

Imagine Space X, with starlink, pulling in $3-5 billion in profit each year.  Musk has more than enough money - he's shown a proclivity for wanting to do interesting things with it. So he lands on the moon and mars just for fun, as a stunt, or because some government pays him to be the first. 

Once starship is built, well, the solar system is our oyster.  The moon, mars, Venus and the asteroids anyway.  Add a simple nuclear drive, built on the moon, and anywhere in the solar system is accessible.  You don't think someone will pay a $1 billion a ticket to cruise out to Jupiter?

I'm not saying we'll do it because we can only explore in person, we'll do it because it is fun and exciting.

Geoman,

<i>I'm not saying we'll do it because we can only explore in person, we'll do it because it is fun and exciting.</i>

Perhaps, but that day is far away.  A trip to Mars, at present, would involve three people in a little can for 6 months, inhaling and exhaling the same air all that time, and then again when at Mars.  No fun.  

A luxurious experience to, at, and from Mars, while possible someday, is still very far away, and will happen later than thousands of AIs taking up residence at Jupiter and further distances.  

Lets see if there is tourism of any scale to the bottom of the Marianna's Trench first, before we can say Space tourism is within even 10 years of that point.

On a planet of 10 billion people, with a total world GDP of >$200 trillion, you're saying there won't be 100 or a thousand people willing to relocate to the Moon or Mars?  I think you'll have no problem finding a few hundred brave souls to colonize whatever you set your sights on.  

Climbing Everest is NOT fun.  It is not a luxury excursion.  Yet hundreds of people are attempting it each year.  Each is spending $50k for the privilege.

Geoman,

Deep sea tourism that goes down 2000 feet to a wreck is different from Challenger Deep.  Challenger Deep is more analogous to a precursor to space.  Note that James Cameron went by himself, paying out of his own pocket.  That is not a market where a civilian can just buy a ticket.

Plus, something that is 1-3 days is different from a two-year Mars trip, one year of which is transit.  

<i>you're saying there won't be 100 or a thousand people willing to relocate to the Moon or Mars? </i>

Not at $50 million/ticket.  At $50,000, maybe.  

And this is before they realize that a) they are in a tin can with two other guys for 6 months each way, all inhaling and exhaling the same air, and b) 99% of the volunteers will be male.  

Let us see this number get above 20 consistently before we can actually confirm something is happening :

Well, Cameron is a civilian, and paid for his ticket.  

You seem to be hung up on the price of the ticket or the ease of obtaining one - If visiting the moon is a million bucks a person, there will be plenty of travelers, given there are 50 million millionaires on earth.  You don't think there will be a hundred willing to buy a ticket?  Heck, they'll be giving tickets away as game show prizes at that price.

Musk has >$50 billion and wants to build a Mars colony.  I suspect he'll pay for everyone's "ticket." even if it is $50 million per ride.  If it costs him $5 billion so be it.  Its not just the reduction in cost, but the increase in wealth.


<a href="https://www.space.com/minor-planets-beyond-neptune-dark-energy-survey.html">https://www.space.com/minor-planets-beyond-neptune-dark-energy-survey.html</a>

139 new objects discovered all at once in orbit beyond Neptune. The researchers started out with 7 billion dots, which they whittled down to 22 million "transients" after ruling out objects that appeared in roughly the same spot on multiple nights. Those 22 million were further culled to 400 planetary candidates.  Of those 319 were small trans neptunium objects.  139 were new to science.

It's not just robotics.  Increasingly we don't even need to send robots anywhere - just crunch huge masses of data to get the answer.

Geoman,

We'll see.  But I doubt it, since it is not necessary for scientific progress or ATOM advancement.  

Again, at the moment there are only 3 people in space (that too in low Earth orbit), there have rarely been over 10, and there have never been over 15.  

<a href="https://www.howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com/">https://www.howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com/</a>

When that number is consistently above 20 (a pretty low bar), then we can see if that is an indication of some fundamental shift having begun.  If that then subsequently rises above 50, then we may have something.  

I am not saying that it will <i>never</i> happen, but rather that thousands of small hardware units with advanced AI will be diffused throughout the solar system long before there are 20 humans on the ground on Mars at once.  Also, interest in space will move towards SETI and asteroid mining (also with robots) rather than the concept of humans on Mars or even the Moon.  

It is true that telescopic power rises at 26%/yr.  But small hardware with AI sent by the thousands will provide views from many angles at low cost.

Now, not only are user reviews easy to find, but pictures of many menu items are posted on Yelp itself.&nbsp; This information arms the diner with much more awareness of the menu, and enables the restaurant to avoid being castigated due to a misinformed order by the diner.&nbsp; The same applies to checking the reviews of a new film or theater production beforehand, greatly reducing the chance of a negative surprise after the sunk cost of tickets.&nbsp; Dentists, auto mechanics, photographers, hairdressers, etc. can be similarly vetted from a computer screen.&nbsp; This new convenience to the consumer experience is not recorded favorably in GDP calculations, even though millions of instances of dissatisfaction and lost time have been avoided.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Automobile commuters with good jobs but lengthy commutes have joined Uber-type platforms to take a rider along with them on <em>the commute they have to undertake anyway</em>. The driver earns an extra $200-$400/week (against which an appropriate portion of car and smartphone costs can be applied as deductions) with no incremental input time or cost.&nbsp; Meanwhile, other commuters enjoy having one less car on the road for each such dynamically generated carpooling pair.&nbsp; The key is that a dead commute is now monetized even by corporate-class people, increasing passengers per car and reducing traffic congestion, while replacing dedicated taxicabs.&nbsp; For the macroeconomy, it also creates new VM where none existed before.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A trifecta of new technologies has enabled small manufacturers to experience a phoenix-like resurgence in the US. Fracking has toppled the price of US natural gas to a sixth of what it was in 2007, bestowing any gas-intensive manufacturer with a major cost advantage over non-US rivals.&nbsp; Low-cost 3D Printing has lowered scale as a barrier to entry for many types of manufacturing and prototyping.&nbsp; Manufacturing robots can perform many tasks better than human workers, 24/7/365, at a cost as low as $1/hour, while being continuously augmented with new software updates.&nbsp; The rise of the solo advanced manufacturer is now upon us, with individuals operating out of a small space producing and selling millions of dollars of high-margin goods.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have you done enough aggregate Internet searching and forum commenting to capture all the low-hanging fruits available to you for your personal advancement and risk management?&nbsp; If you answer that question in the affirmative, I am here to tell you that you have not come even close to realizing what is possible.&nbsp; Even heavily committed people barely access 10% of the information that could greatly improve their careers, finances, health, and relationships, and I don’t think there is anyone in the world, no matter how successful, who has implemented more than 50% of what is available to them.&nbsp; I myself am nowhere near this level.</p>
<p>Recall the earlier point about how it is now possible to research in minutes what used to take half a day in the public library (that too if you were fortunate enough to be in a country that even had public libraries at the time).&nbsp;&nbsp; Add to that the ability to get your questions answered in forums like Yahoo Answers, Quora, etc.&nbsp; Then combine that with connections between different memes, factoids, and tangents that would not have been visible in the glacial pace of information accrual and exchange before Internet search and forums.&nbsp; Integrating all this, you can see how your ability to access and implement valuable information can take a great leap forward, and how almost everyone can participate in the creation of knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Case Studies of Personal Third Millennium Economics : &nbsp;</strong>Sometimes, a story can better illustrate the ways a person savvy to the disruptive and augmentative nature of new technologies can rapidly upgrade one or more aspects of their life.&nbsp; There is more fluidity and mobility across classes and strata than was possible before, and the ATOM is now the land of opportunity.&nbsp; The following are four examples of how someone might adapt and thrive within the new realities of Third Millennium Economics.</p>
<p>1) Lisa wanted to become an exceptionally good amateur chef, but back in 1998, she found the available instructional materials to be limited and uninspiring.&nbsp; Every cooking show on TV required the viewer to be interested in the item being presented in that specific episode, with no way for the viewer to search for their own preferences.&nbsp; Cookbooks were not a good solution either, for each ingredient listed in a recipe required that item to be purchased in a larger quantity, leaving remainder quantities of each item in the refrigerator and pantry.&nbsp; Lisa wondered for years <em>why none of these cookbooks had a matrix in the back of the book, linking ingredients across recipes, to make the shopping process for the layperson more efficient and less wasteful.&nbsp; </em>Lisa found this oversight among the sum total of published cookbooks to be quite ridiculous.&nbsp; She knew that there was major overlap in the basics of cooking, but this was not easy for an amateur to discover without taking an expensive cooking class.</p>
<p>By around 2004, however, something began to change.&nbsp; Lisa found that many of the premier French, Italian, and Indian chefs were posting knowledge online.&nbsp; The common theme among them began to emerge.&nbsp; Great chefs think not in terms of compliance to a fixed recipe, but rather see what ingredients are available, and create a production from them.&nbsp; Cooking has to be bottom-up, not top-down.&nbsp; The ‘eureka’ moment for Lisa was that she could simply type ingredients into Google, and recipes that utilize those ingredients would come up.&nbsp; This was vastly more efficient than a cookbook, and allowed Lisa to get past the learning bottleneck holding her and others back.&nbsp; She could also now buy certain perishables without worrying about exactly what she will make from them as the clock ticks.&nbsp; The arrival of YouTube was another godsend, where, unlike a regularly scheduled cooking show, the user can merely search for whatever recipe she wants.&nbsp; A video is far easier to emulate than a text recipe, and further expanded upon the list of perishable ingredients she can now purchase in a shopping trip.</p>
<p>After years of stagnation, Lisa’s skills improved rapidly after these revelations, and she even posted some of her own cooking videos to YouTube.&nbsp; Comment feedback from like-minded viewers led to additional improvements.&nbsp; Lisa eventually reached a level of expertise where she was able to produce cuisine that met or exceeded what was available at fine restaurants, with her YouTube channel accruing over 1,000,000 subscribers, elevating her hobby to a full-time, commute-free career.</p>
<p>2) Fred always had a keen financial mind, and wanted to do better with generating a return in his IRA and his brokerage account, for he knew that this is just as important as his paycheck from his day job.&nbsp; He did not believe in individual stocks, for he knew he was unlikely to ever close the information disadvantage he had relative to institutions and those very close to the companies.&nbsp; He also found mutual funds to be uninspiring due to their high fees, and the inability to short them or write options on them.</p>
<p>The advent of Yahoo Finance in the late 1990s made a wealth of information available for free, but most of the information was still about individual stocks, which was not Fred’s target.&nbsp; In the process of mining Yahoo Finance, he found a great deal of information on options, as well as daily quotes that were previously unavailable so freely.&nbsp; It was exceedingly difficult for a layperson to research, let alone trade options before the late 1990s, with truly abundant information only appearing around 2005 or so.&nbsp; The discovery process made Fred knowledgeable about options, and eventually futures.&nbsp; As computing and data transmission became cheaper, brokerage firms were able to lower their trading commissions.&nbsp; Fred began to create algorithms to generate returns strictly from options and futures of broadly traded commodities, such as oil, gold, natural gas, and ^vix volatility.&nbsp; Despite some early setbacks, he eventually was able to generate 30-50% annual compounded returns from his algorithms, built around the principle of capturing the various time decays (option decay, futures contango, leverage decay) inherent to those instruments.</p>
<p>As these returns became routine for Fred, his day job became optional, and he gave some thought to managing client money full-time and establishing a hedge fund.&nbsp; Fortunately, in the Internet age, it was easy for him to locate attorneys, auditors, and other service providers.&nbsp; By shopping around, he found that the Internet had increased competition amongst these providers, and thus the fixed costs associated with operating a hedge fund have fallen from about $500,000/year to just $30,000/year, greatly reducing the minimum assets needed for the hedge fund to be viable.&nbsp; Fred’s hedge fund became sustainable with just $10 Million in assets, a threshold unheard of in the past, and he joined the new layer of hedge funds with under $20 Million in assets under management returning over 30%/year.&nbsp; &nbsp;The ability to run his fund from anywhere enabled him to relocate to a preferred destination.</p>
<p>This story is not to say that the percentage of people who become good at generating returns has increased, but rather accessibility is now far more democratic, permitting talented people from outside the establishment to make use of skills that may have gone to waste in the past.&nbsp; On this front, we are still only at the beginning.</p>
<p>3) James is an accountant, and has been employed at a large multinational corporation for over 15 years.&nbsp; As a top performer, he enjoys higher job security than his peers, but is nonetheless apprehensive about the speed at which his colleagues are vanishing and being subsumed by AI.&nbsp; After reading a number of frightening articles in the media, James was deeply worried about how long he could stay ahead of the machines.</p>
<p>Then, one fine day, James came across this publication, and began to see AI in a different light.&nbsp; It dawned on him that what he was observing was not the utter disappearance of accounting jobs into thin air, but that an accounting department with ten accountants at a payroll cost of $2M/yr could now generate the same services for a mere $100,000/yr (and falling) in AI costs and a sole human manager.&nbsp; James started to ponder the implications of starting his own accounting firm, where the work that could bring in $2M/yr in fees could be performed just by him and this new AI capability.&nbsp; His deep knowledge of accounting and reputation in his field meant he could accommodate a large portion of his former employer’s accounting work into his own private practice, on top of acquiring additional clients.&nbsp; One man and his AI was now doing the work of ten, and could earn the income formerly earned by those ten.&nbsp; Until now, most solo practitioner accountants only handled smaller individual clients, and it was unheard of that a single-person firm could presume to undertake the enormity of work generated by an entire corporate department.&nbsp; James was one of the revolutionaries changing this, even though he never thought he would become an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>As happens whenever a new business model becomes highly profitable, James’ success attracted competitors and pricing pressures began to manifest.&nbsp; At the same time, this competition created many additional jobs in sales, marketing, and support.&nbsp; Next, the market itself grew from the entry of smaller firms that could now avail themselves of elite accounting services previously beyond their reach.&nbsp; The ecosystem began to mature, but James continued to earn several times more than he did as a corporate employee, simply by continuing to refine the implementation of AI in his practice.</p>
<p>Lastly, what of the other accountants who saw their positions eliminated, and are not as talented as James?&nbsp; Well, some were able to get jobs in accounting working alongside AI, while others had to transition to different careers.&nbsp; This illustrates why the cushioning effect of the universal minimum stipend supplied by central bank monetary expansion is so essential, as it ensures that everyone gets some return from pervasive and accelerating forces of technological disruption while conducting their own transitions.</p>
<p>4) The legendary 'Delta Team' is a team of three video game creators who had produced a sequence of extremely successful titles.&nbsp; The team was widely acclaimed in their field, and they were able to do almost every aspect of game production for a top-flight game by themselves.&nbsp; But in the past, they were dependent on working within large game companies for the brand, corporate-class resources, and distribution channel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Delta Team's successes accumulated, even the brand of the large company that housed them became secondary to their own, but the distribution channel kept them chained.&nbsp; Video games in 2006 sold as boxed products, and while one could buy the box online, most sales were still through brick and mortar stores.&nbsp; The boxed product in the form of CDs or DVDs did not have a large fixed cost per unit (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983">unlike the cartridges that caused an infamous inventory bust in 1983</a>), but still required capital outlay, production time, packaging, and shipping.&nbsp; After that, the retailer margin consumed 30% of the retail price, even stocking a retail channel had onerous requirements of inventory.&nbsp; This had to be done again and again for each country, often with translation requirements for retail packaging, leading to complicated supply/demand mismatches that were tedious to rectify.&nbsp; This led to each boxed game selling for a retail price of $50.&nbsp; Hence, over 20,000 boxed copies had to be produced for a rudimentary launch, and that too only for the US, UK, and Australia.&nbsp; Unsold units carried a risk of an expensive write-down.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as the ATOM progressed, the convergence of broadband, anti-piracy technologies, price declines of advanced tools, and more, it became possible for the Delta Team to produce games entirely by themselves.&nbsp; Their YouTube livestreams of gameplay during development created a direct connection between the developers and their customers, which enabled feedback to be incorporated into the game itself.&nbsp; Furthermore, they were now able to sell games exclusively through a website via unique downloads, thereby removing dependency on the big corporate umbrella and large retailers that require upfront inventory, as well as country-by-country permits and retail localization.&nbsp; Suddenly, forecasting sales was no longer an important part of the equation, as long as revenue met a minimum threshold for a certain game to be justified on the production roadmap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Delta Team could now operate as their own independent company for the first time ever.&nbsp; In this age, they could sell games for $30 instead of the previous $50, while earning about the same per unit sale.&nbsp; Customers in countries that would have been too cumbersome to stock with retail inventory in 2006 were instantly available.&nbsp; Best of all, the situation of boxed games needing to be destocked from brick and mortar retail because a certain retail chain required at least 300 units/week in sales no longer existed, as residual sales for successful games continued for years after this point, which could be serviced by the download purchase model.&nbsp; The Delta Team collectively agreed to relocate to a tax haven and produce games on their own.&nbsp; They churned out game after game that sold 100,000 units or more, or $3 Million in revenue each.&nbsp; Hence, all three members of the Delta Team achieved a great combination of success and independence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a4fdfc82200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20240a4fdfc82200d img-responsive" alt="ATOM small" title="ATOM small" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a4fdfc82200d-320wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a></p>
<p>These are just four examples of how someone might view the advent of accelerating technological disruption as an endless stream of opportunity, no matter what field someone works in.&nbsp; I have detailed maps for how specific professions, such as engineering, marketing, product management, investment banking, management consulting, medicine, and law could each supercharge their careers with greater Third Millennium Economics awareness.&nbsp; The savvy and observant individual has a galaxy of avenues from which to choose from, ensuring that more of the future is distributed towards them.&nbsp; Everyone is surrounded by dozens of such avenues to pursue, no matter what your technical expertise, age, or station in life.</p>

Are the detailed maps for specific professions available ?   I would love to see the one for engineering, and some of the other professions.

Thanks!

Hi Scott,

Yes, I do have maps for several types of engineering, including circuit design, software engineering, mechanical engineering, etc.  

While the detailed maps will be part of a consulting/coaching practice that is currently being built out, I can disclose certain basics.

Well, I personally am a mechanical engineer (aerospace), attempting to change careers into software engineering (thus far unsuccessfully), and running a hobby level but increasingly promising Math/Statistics blog & selling Math/Statistics Kindle books.

So I would be interesting in any information for those fields that you were able to share

Love the huge data dump of the ATOM book!

Scott,

One important area is the software of 3D Printing.  It is a good combination of both MechE (although not aerospace) and software principles.  

I did in fact run an entire non-profit devoted to exactly this :
<a href="https://kprize.wordpress.com/">https://kprize.wordpress.com/</a>

In terms of aerospace specifically, private spaceflight is finally a real field.  There is quite a bit of software involved in that as well, since the endgame is to miniaturize spacecraft to tiny sizes and house artificial intelligence within them, which thus becomes the most effective method of space exploration ever.  

Check out SpaceX and similar companies as a starting point.

How would one do this?  Where would they even start?

Computer_Guy524,

It is something that takes a certain talent + years of experience, but I am going to be teaching an Options and Futures class at Stanford in Spring 2017.  

In general, don't think in terms of stock picking.  Think instead in terms of indices, options decay, futures decay, and so on.

Hi KG,

Thanks for getting back to me.

Is this class going to be hosted somewhere like on coursera?  I'd love to follow along.  Also, what sort of talent would one need?

CG524,

It won't be on Coursera, it is on-site at Stanford.  I guess you are not in the Bay Area..

The talents needed are a) mathematics, b) economics, c) finance, d) ability to not freak out when positions move against you, as holding often leads to recoupment, but hasty liquidation is problematic, e) ability to keep things secret, and not get drawn into conversations about individual stocks at parties (which is always a waste of time).

The key is to think in terms of options decay, futures decay/contango, and remember that indices always trump individual stockpicking.

Hello,

I have been supplementing my engineering income by writing non-fiction technical books and selling them on Amazon Kindle.  I have reasonable expectations that this might be worth $40,000 in sales this year.  This is income that wouldn't have been possible 10 years ago, since kindle didn't exist.

However I am curious to know if you have any suggestions as to how I as an author can use accelerating technology to increase that income.  What are some key things to look at to either increase my ability to write more content more quickly or attract more readers?    I would love to get some really good voice to text, or handwriting to text, which would both allow me to remove work that I am currently doing and turn dead time in to productive time.

Thanks!

Scott,

That is good.  You are thinking the right way.  To generate an income that was not possible before is precisely the right track to be on.  

To speed up income gains, you can take some copyediting work and have one of those offshore service providers do it for cheap.  If that saves you time and increases your book output, that is a productivity increase.

Some speech-to-text software may also increase productivity, but different ones fit with different people's styles.

Plus, make sure your book royalty income is tax-efficient, with all sorts of expenses related to the work written off against the income.  

For attracting readers, it is tough given the subject matter, but periodically comment on LinkedIn, referencing your book, so that your personal brand increases and your network sees you as an expert.  Make sure your LinkedIn rises to over 1000 contacts, in order to amplify this network effect.  If you have thousands of readers who purchased your publications, then be sure to merge this with LinkedIn postings, and maybe even do meetups or speak at conferences devoted to the subject matter.  All of this raises your professional profile, and will bring more/better job offers for your day job as well.

Thank you, I appreciate the input.  Outsourcing more of the work is something I definitely need to put some more attention on.

I hadn't thought of using Linkedin for that purpose, so that is definitely something to work on.

BODY:
<div class="entry-content">
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If a man is proud of his wealth, he should not be praised until it is known how he employs it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>–&nbsp;</em>Socrates</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZXQ1Feu-WI&amp;feature=youtu.be">(Video)</a></span>. &nbsp;Given how recently the world economy has entered this situation of accelerating technological deflation, only the most prosperous and technology-dense countries currently have the ability to generate central bank money in a perpetual and rising stream, and in turn divert it to fund their government spending.&nbsp; Sometimes, a country is closer or further from this threshold than countries of similar prosperity.</p>
<p>While the transformation is a continuum, in general, a nation has to cross a threshold where technological products are approximately 3% of its GDP, which the US has recently surpassed.&nbsp; At the 3% threshold, there is a sufficient buffer against inflation upticks in the early incubatory period, where critics still have followers.&nbsp; For example, the nations of Northwestern Europe could embark on this restructuring right away, but the nations of Southern and Eastern Europe are not quite there yet.&nbsp; The EU cannot easily blend the varying ATOM levels of different countries into one and expect ECB monetary expansion to diffuse evenly.&nbsp; Similarly, while China as of 2020 has a similar prosperity as Latin America, the technological depth of China’s economy makes China fewer years away from this transformation than Mexico and Brazil are.</p>
<p>There was a time when vast reserves of natural resources (such as oil) were seen as the most fortuitous stroke of luck for a nation to have.&nbsp; In this age, the tables are turned, where having significant ATOM density is an even more profitable resource, and unlike oil, is self-reinforcing and ever-expanding.&nbsp; Ironically, the countries that were the most deprived of natural resources (such as Japan and South Korea) had to rely heavily on technology to further their economies, which has now made them among the most ready for the marriage of the ATOM with central bank monetary creation.</p>
<p>While the US has reached a point where it can implement this only at this stage at $65,000 per capita GDP, China could implement this upon reaching a mere $20,000 per capita in the mid-2020s.&nbsp; This is simply due to the percentage of Chinese GDP that will be composed of ATOM-derived deflationary products approaching 3%, despite being merely at a similar level of prosperity as the US was in the 1970s.&nbsp; Even impoverished, low-tech India can implement this by the 2030s, despite still being much poorer at that point than the US is in 2020, due to the same 3% threshold.</p>
<p>Each country has to do an ATOM assessment to determine if their central bank can generate money without generating inflation, and if not, how many years away they might be from such a capability.&nbsp; I have detailed data and algorithms that can help each country estimate where it is on the progression towards the Third Millennium Economics threshold, but for the purposes of this publication, I will discuss a few select countries and their specific characteristics, starting with the United States.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>How the US Can Inaugurate Third Millennium Economics </strong>:&nbsp; I repeat that there is virtually no chance that these topics will be researched, the ideological barriers overcome, the Federal Reserve’s powers expanded, and an ATOM-ready DUES program implemented before it is done by a number of smaller countries first.&nbsp; I am also relatively certain that the US will not be the first, second, or even fourth country to implement such a revamp of its monetary and fiscal paradigms (more on those other countries later).&nbsp; But if the US were to hypothetically start this program by 2020, one attractive avenue (as an alternative to starting with the flat $5000/year to all US citizen adults) to ease into it is through that venerable old program, Social Security.</p>
<p>As of 2019, Social Security (SS) collected about $1.2 Trillion in taxes, and distributed roughly the same $1.2 Trillion sum out to recipients.&nbsp; The tax is 12.4% of the employee’s income, up to $137,700 of income, after which there is no tax.&nbsp; While there is an illusion that this 12.4% is split between the employee and employer, this is obviously money that would otherwise land in the pocket of either if not for the tax, and is certainly a contributor to angst about the ‘lack of wage growth’.&nbsp; The SS payout formula calculates payments with some correlation to how much a worker paid into the system, but the correlation is not exact.&nbsp; There are other complicated calculations for spouses of workers, immigrants who were in America for a period but never became US citizens, and so on, all of which are often gamed and exploited.&nbsp; There is the additional cost incurred by the fact that millions of households would not need to file tax returns at all if not for SS, which adds volume to the already-bursting IRS processing system.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of apprehension about the future of the SS program, since US demographics are far less favorable than they were in the first 70 years of SS.&nbsp; The age at which a person can receive benefits was set when US life expectancy was itself around 65, and now, the powerful senior lobby prevents the government from indexing the eligibility age to rising life expectancy.&nbsp; This means that the average duration of receivership has increased from 2-3 years to 12-15 years, or roughly six times longer, even though the duration of working-age payments into the system has not increased.&nbsp; The ratio of intake to payouts has thus been very adversely affected by what should be celebrated – rising life expectancy.&nbsp; This in turn leads to a rather peculiar and morbid opposition to rising lifespans in some quarters, as if the fear of updating a government program from another era is more important than the single most comprehensive indicator of societal well-being.</p>
<p>Instead, since we know that the central banks of the world will soon have to permanently generate well above $4 Trillion/year, it would be appropriate to directly fund all SS obligations with that very monetary influx, making good use of this established distribution channel.&nbsp; Simultaneously, the regressive SS tax can be the first income tax to be eliminated.&nbsp; The recipients see no change in their payment amount, but gain the eventual benefit of their SS money now being exempt from income tax (unlike today) due to the commencement of the income tax phase-out.&nbsp; Note that the monthly increases in the ATOM stipend are far more granular than the annual SS increases, to facilitate dynamic responses to inflation changes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, working-age people and their employers immediately get more money in their hands to the tune of 12.4% of their paychecks up to the first $137,700, which creates a huge surge in consumer spending and job creation.&nbsp; Debt servicing becomes easier for individuals, and since all other types of income tax are still in effect, those tax collections rise as a ripple effect.&nbsp; The US enjoys a win-win all around, all because the Federal Reserve has to produce that much money anyway to offset technological deflation.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201b7c86ce597970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e201b7c86ce597970b img-responsive" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Old and New" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201b7c86ce597970b-500wi" alt="Old and New" /></a>After the inaugural year of funding a government spending program with Federal Reserve QE proves that neither the inflation rate nor fiscal budget was destroyed in the process, it is time to increase this disbursement by the annual 16-24% to match the higher degree of technological penetration in the economy.&nbsp; This should be done by merely extending the payout down the age brackets to people younger than the SS recipients, one age cohort at a time.&nbsp; By 2020, every US citizen over the age of 18 is receiving their payout, while the Federal Reserve is now dispensing over $2.3 Trillion per year ($10,000+/year/person), with broad recognition that Federal Reserve QE has to permanently rise at 16-24%/year.&nbsp; Inflation is no longer a serious concern, since the expansion is within the aegis of Third Millennium Economics.</p>
<p>As the DUES is extended to all US citizens, other government wealth transfer programs should be steadily and proportionally phased out.&nbsp; The order in which this is done has to be decided by policy researchers, but over the 3-5 years that it takes to extend the stipend all the way down to age 18, every Federal payment program from Medicare to the Pell Grant to food stamps should commence the retirement process.&nbsp; This achieves the goal of replacing the 75% of US government spending comprised of payments to individuals with the vastly more efficient and fair DUES.&nbsp; The stipend will rapidly become large enough where it can allow anyone to purchase private health insurance of varying coverage.&nbsp; This retires the system of the government paying healthcare providers directly, thereby distorting prices, reducing efficiency, and throttling innovation.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the rest of the income tax code can follow the SS tax into the pages of history.&nbsp; This is best achieved by sequentially eliminating each category of tax one by one, based on how similar to a payment program it already is.&nbsp; After the SS tax, perhaps the Medicare tax can be next, followed by the AMT, the capital gains tax, the corporate income tax, and finally, the ordinary/individual income tax.&nbsp; Note that as each tax is eliminated, the collections from each remaining type of tax balloon from the economic stimulus created by the absence of the previous tax.&nbsp; This cushion should not give pause to the plan of systematically phasing out every one of these taxes, since humans are already handicapped relative to the untaxable and borderless output of AI.</p>
<p>State and local governments do not have their own central banks and cannot run budget deficits, so will have to continue to fund themselves with existing methods of taxation, which vary greatly by location.&nbsp; Some states, like Texas, Florida, and Nevada have no income tax, while others like California have top bracket rates as high as 13.3%.&nbsp; Some cities have no income tax, and property taxes also vary greatly.&nbsp; High-tax states might see the vacancy created by the absence of Federal income tax as an excuse to greatly increase state income tax, but this would be a blunder, as the absence of Federal income tax will greatly widen the spread between states with unequal business friendliness.&nbsp; Furthermore, states with income tax rely on the Federal 1040 for a verification of taxable income, but once the Federal 1040 is gone, states will have to do their own auditing and verification.&nbsp; The competition between states and cities will become more direct, which, in a way, was the original intention of the Founding Fathers over two centuries ago.</p>
<p>The remaining 25% (and shrinking) of US Federal spending not in the form of payments to individuals can also be funded with money originated by the Federal Reserve.&nbsp; Just as with state and local governments, the real test with this component of government spending is whether the voters and officials can keep these expenditures contained, or succumb to the urge to overspend.&nbsp; Maintenance of the Third Millennium Economy, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/7-government-policies-must-adapt-and-quickly.html">as described earlier</a></span>, will be a key determinant of competitiveness between nations, with societies that fail to maintain this resource swiftly incurring the penalty of seeing others surpass them.</p>
<p>Lest there be any confusion about the speed at which such a transition could be managed, I emphasize that the full expenditures of the US Federal government <em>cannot</em> hypothetically be funded as soon as 2020 by central bank action alone, as the ATOM is just not broad and deep enough yet to produce enough deflation.&nbsp; Rather, the transition has to be structured to intercept the ATOM at a point a decade away, and staged accordingly.&nbsp; By around 2025, unless another country moves first to capture the entire world's ATOM dividend for itself, the previous calculations predict that the ATOM will be advanced enough to metabolize a level of perma-QE where every US citizen over age 18 gets a stipend that by then has grown to $12,000/year in current dollars and keeps rising each year, pushing ‘Real’ GDP growth rates higher despite low inflation.&nbsp; The Federal income tax, now entirely phased out, is recognized as a relic of a bygone age.</p>
<p>A vision of this theoretical 2025 America presents itself.&nbsp; The economic climate at all levels of American society is fundamentally transformed.&nbsp; Careers are plentiful and compensation is more closely aligned with productivity than before.&nbsp; Entrepreneurship has become more widespread and lucrative, and is now the largest occupation, with clusters of tech startups sprouting in all cities.&nbsp; Inflation is minor, and many products cost the same or less than they did in 2020, particularly when adjusting for ATOM impact on product quality.&nbsp; Debates about living wages, minimum wages, federal tax hikes, and two-income traps have vanished into the dustbin of history.&nbsp; Even if state, local, sales, and property taxes still exist, the burden seems minor, and governance in most state and city governments has improved, partly due to a reduction in some categories of crime, and the government resources freed up through this.</p>
<p>At the highest macroeconomic level, the US National Debt, which has recently crossed the psychologically significant threshold of 100% of GDP for the first time in a non-war economy, ceases to grow since government spending no longer generates a deficit funded by US Treasury debt.&nbsp; The $23 Trillion of existing Treasury bills, notes, and bonds will shrink as each individual debt contract matures and expires without being replaced with new debt contracts from a new deficit.&nbsp; This eventually makes the entire debt, which is going to be a major factor in exacerbating the pain of the next eventual recession as previously described, gradually shrink and disappear.&nbsp; Thus, the supposedly ominous National Debt and budget deficits become a non-factors in future fiscal policy structuring under this model.</p>
<p>Not every problem dwindles away, of course.&nbsp; If America of 2020 has proven anything, it is that some people just cannot handle prosperity.&nbsp; When serious problems recede away, they devote their lives towards inventing new ones, as the endlessly mutating victim-chic culture demonstrates.&nbsp; Some people will always concoct new grievances as a cloak through which they resentfully harass others, and most of the tired old shibboleths will continue.&nbsp; What may be different is that AI may greatly empower the efforts of factseekers, enabling them to obstruct the grievance extortionists more effectively than is possible now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where the second-choice program, the Sovereign Venture Fund (SVF), becomes an alternative.&nbsp; Since the first-mover country is effectively capturing the entire world's ATOM deflation for domestic benefit, it should have its central bank generate a full $1 Trillion (possible $2 Trillion), and keep <em>it in a segregated account and out of the domestic economy</em>, as this actually would cause inflation if it circulated.&nbsp; Then, before another country becomes aware of this, deploy it into overseas allocations (equities, real estate, etc.) as quickly as possible.&nbsp; Hence, these are positions now owned by the SVF, and can then be more precisely deployed into projects or technologies that specifically hedge domestic risk.&nbsp; This can make far more speculative bets than a Sovereign Wealth Fund, which was built through decades of taxpayer money and understandably wants to be more risk averse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I have stressed, no country will even begin to implement this plan in the immediate future, and even then, the US will definitely not be the first to embark on this path.&nbsp; But there are four countries with unique attributes that enable them to be the first to reap the benefits of this approach to fiscal and monetary governance.&nbsp; These four countries, which happen to be four of the best-managed economies in the world, consist of two single-party Pacific Rim city-states, Hong Kong and Singapore, and two Western democracies, Canada and Switzerland.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hong Kong and Singapore : </strong>&nbsp;Hong Kong and Singapore have shared origins that led them to become &nbsp;city-state tax havens with small, efficient governments.&nbsp; Both have per-capita GDPs that are manifold higher than the countries they were separated from (China and Malaysia, respectively), and their economies have high ATOM densities.&nbsp; Both are routinely ranked within the top four financial centers in the world, despite having been quite poor as recently as the 1970s.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_government_budgets_by_country">Each of these city-states has a government budget of about $60 Billion/year</a></span>.&nbsp; As small nations with very high interconnectedness to much larger economies, they could each fund their governments with central bank money, waive all of their already-low taxes, and still be just a rounding error in the world monetary and inflation data.&nbsp; In fact, the inflation rate of Hong Kong and Singapore is more determined by whatever monetary expansion is done by the big central banks of China, Japan, and the US.&nbsp; As a result, both Hong Kong and Singapore can proceed with the full knowledge that their money creation will not cause any significant local inflation or currency devaluation.&nbsp; Once they fund their existing government budgets, they can proceed on their own program to phase out taxes and disburse a DUES, which itself can rise at a faster rate than a larger country could manage.</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Singapore are not democracies, so their political process does not double as an entertainment genre.&nbsp; Hence, the sequence of decisions involved in this sort of restructuring can be made and executed quickly.&nbsp; Due to currency pegs, a currency flight is not a risk.&nbsp; The stipend may have to start small, but can rapidly scale up at speeds a large country could not manage.&nbsp; The stipend could reach $50,000/year within five years, without triggering any domestic inflation.&nbsp; They could, similarly, implement the SVF immediately, at a size of $1 Trillion or more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decades of low-tax, business-friendly policies have cultivated a culture of governance that makes them among the least likely governments to get carried away in a frenzy of ‘free money’ gluttony.&nbsp; Whatever approvals Hong Kong needs from China are unlikely to be a problem given China’s own massive and innovative monetary practices, and inclination to observe how well the Hong Kong experiment works.&nbsp; Success in Hong Kong and Singapore can clarify a roadmap for other countries in the region that could already implement the strategy (Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan), and eventually, the largest practitioner of ATOM monetization in the future (China).</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Canada and Switzerland :</strong>&nbsp; Among Western democracies, there are two very different countries that share the distinction of being the best positioned to transition to the Third Millennium Economics paradigm of fiscal and monetary governance.&nbsp; Traditional disadvantages can now be converted to advantages, in a historic turning of tables.</p>
<p>Canada is in the unique situation of having a sole geographical neighbor with an economy ten times larger, with which Canada conducts most of its trade.&nbsp; Given the high ATOM density of both nations, the inflation rate in Canada can never deviate significantly from that of the United States.&nbsp; At first, it may seem troubling that a major aspect of the Canadian economy is predominantly pegged to how America performs on the same measure.&nbsp; But from what we have seen about the potential re-direction of central bank monetary easing, Canada is superbly well-positioned.</p>
<p>Most Americans are not aware that Canada’s federal government does not typically run a budget deficit.&nbsp; The Canadian government, as of 2019, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Canadian_federal_budget">collects about $340 Billion in tax revenue, and spends a slightly higher $355 Billion in an impressive demonstration of political restraint</a></span>.&nbsp; The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_public_debt">national debt of Canada is only about one third the proportional size of the US debt</a>, a trajectory quite the opposite of the one the US is currently on.</p>
<p>If the Canadian Parliament were to authorize the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada">Canadian central bank</a></span> to merely create the entire $355 Billion of federal expenditures and waive all federal income taxes, the amount of monetary expansion is negligible relative to the broader US money supply.&nbsp; This ensures that there is no possibility of any Canada-specific inflation.&nbsp; It really is that simple, amidst Canada’s favorable conditions (Canada also happens to have a more skill-based immigration policy <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/05/26/409671996/canada-cuts-down-on-red-tape-could-it-work-in-the-u-s"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and better regulatory philosophy than the US at present</span></a>, all of which strengthen the ATOM levels in the country).</p>
<p>Canadian provinces have taxes and budgets of their own, of course, but the entire federal government is already well within the zone where taxation of Canadian citizens is no longer necessary.&nbsp; Due to this, a DUES program can be constructed in short order without generating any discernible inflation in either Canada or the US.&nbsp; For any Canadian reading this, perhaps you should send this reading material to your elected representatives and start urging them to examine these ideas.</p>
<p>Switzerland, by contrast, has arrived at this juncture along a very different path than Canada.&nbsp; Few countries have done more things correctly for as many centuries as Switzerland, which built an economy entirely around high-margin industries and is synonymous with an elite image of wealth and sophistication.&nbsp; Switzerland is not part of the Eurozone currency block, but is completely surrounded by it.&nbsp; The Eurozone economy is about 16 times larger than the Swiss economy, and most of the Eurozone’s GDP is generated within 300 kilometers of the Swiss border, representing a huge ATOM-deflationary sink.&nbsp; This guarantees the Swiss central bank’s ability to generate an almost unlimited amount of money without causing any domestic inflation.</p>
<p>Above and beyond the extremely suitable geographical location, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-25415501">Switzerland has already considered experimenting with the idea of a universal stipend</a></span> (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33977636">as has Finland</a></span>).&nbsp; The only missing piece is to have the stipend paid with money created by the Swiss central bank, rather than by the large tax increase they were considering.&nbsp; As the stream of money increases, the rest of the government budget can draw from this source, while all Swiss income taxes can be gradually eliminated.</p>
<p>Excellent governance, high technology density, their own central banks, and proximity to vastly larger economies with low inflation will hopefully lead Canada and Switzerland to become the first to undergo the legislative and political process of implementing this solution, setting an example for the larger Western democracies to follow.&nbsp; Similar to the example of New Zealand provided in Chapter 7, Canada or Switzerland could also implement a $1 Trillion SVF in the same way, provided one of them moves first.&nbsp; The US and Eurozone will only implement such programs when they already see it succeeding in a smaller Western nation, and that too after the first-mover advantage is no longer available.</p>

Hello,

I chanced upon your blog, after many years.

Please share ATOM impact on India.

As a small-scale manufacturer of components for consumer durables, I am eager to know your predictions for India, with its 1.2 billion population and millions of problems.

Technology is already having impact on the IT outsourcing business, with layoffs happening and recruitment outlook becoming bleak. Companies are moving up value chain than  merely offering cost arbitrage.

Uber and Ola is disrupting taxi and sort distance travel market, but Govt has started regulating them.

With millions of youth expected to to join job hunt each month,with no sensible plan to absorb them into working population, India could be staring at a disaster.

Govt has started some initiatives like skilling the youth, I am skeptical.

Would love to hear your views.

Hello Joe,

India has a very low technological density, which is why it still is one of the few places with inflation.  Even China does not have inflation.

As the ATOM penetrates India, progress will be quick, but disruption will be unusually rapid.  Basically, everything will be in fast forward.  

Artificial intelligence can be of great use to India, for the AI that can displace even US jobs can be used in India for high output with low input.

But India will not get to a DUES until the 2030s.

Ok. Both don't have hard pegs (currency boards with 100% reserves -- in which they couldn't do this DUES thing at all) but soft pegs, which are challenged on the international forex markets every day. So , in order to maintain their pegs, they have to withdraw base money from circulation if the target pegged price rises or add base money when it drops.. Which defeats the purpose of what you are trying to do. Next...

"If the Canadian Parliament were to authorize the Canadian central bank to merely create the entire $300 Billion of federal expenditures and waive all federal income taxes, the amount of monetary expansion is negligible relative to the broader US money supply.  This ensures that there is no possibility of any Canada-specific inflation."

That makes ZERO sense.  I mean, this Modern Monetary Theory chartelist crack pipe is truly getting out of hand.  

US dollar are not the currency used for internal trade in Canada.  Thus greatly expanding the Canadian monetary supply means more Canadian money being used to outbid previous prices in Canadian transactions. It's like how ever expanding mortgage credit impacting monetary velocity does the same with housing prices.

"Due to this, a DUES program can be constructed in short order without generating any discernible inflation in either Canada or the US. "

Canada pumping out more of its base money wouldn't effect US inflation levels anyway, ATOM or not.   

Being a Zimbabwe is simply being a Zimbabwe regardless of where it is or who it's trading partners are.

Zyndryl,

We have already seen that QE flows across borders without hindrance.  Canada's small size relative to the US, and the fact that overseas trade (particularly with the US) is such a large portion of their economy means that large action by the Canadian Central Bank will not create inflation in Canada, even in most intra-Canada transactions.  

But that does not make Canada a Zimbabwe.  Quite the opposite in fact.  Canada can fund a DUES without taxation, and can ramp up to that in a very short time if it wanted to.

QE from the US only flows out because the dollar is the world's reserve currency. Canada's is not.  So dollars can be used in Vietnam to buy oil from Saudi Arabia, copper from Chile and precision machining equipment from Germany, for example. Nobody does that with Canadian money.

So yes, that would make Canada a Zimbabwe if it printed money into circulation above the natural market demand for it.  Because like in Zimbabwe, Canada's money is only mostly used in Canada, for transactions involving a limited number of services and commodities within Canada -- which would be chased by way too many Canadian dollars in circulation.

Zyndryl,

<i>QE from the US only flows out because the dollar is the world's reserve currency.</i>

No.  Japan's QE flows out of Japan and into the US, China, etc.  Same with the EU's QE.  

All QE just flows into the worldwide total.  This is well established by evidence that the US inflation rate had upticks during the first few months of Japan's QE (while US QE was constant).  

Even China's large QE injections (which are big one-offs, rather than monthly programs) were evident in their simultaneous jolts to US indicators.

Hello Drew,

In terms of the size of the ATOM, most certainly.

In terms of the US migrating towards this sort of fiscal and monetary revamp, the chance is still zero.  Outdated thought is way too entrenched.

Andrew Yang has moved the concept of a UBI into the Overton Window, but he still wants to increase taxes to fund it, which makes it plain old socialism.  But at least the UBI concept has legs.

From 1992:

<a href="http://ota.polyonymo.us/others-papers/NetAssetTax_Bowery.txt">http://ota.polyonymo.us/others-papers/NetAssetTax_Bowery.txt</a>

"The government should tax net assets, in excess of levels
typically protected under personal bankruptcy, at a rate equal to
the rate of interest on the national debt, thereby eliminating
other forms of taxation.  Creator-owned intellectual property
should be exempt.
...
With the exception of basic functions of government and the pay
down of debt, the government budget should be dispersed to
citizens as cash, rather than being spent in government programs
or even limited in the form of vouchers.  This is "market
democracy" in which the citizens and their markets, rather than
central planning and politics, influence the selection of goods
and services to be capitalized and provided."

<div class="entry-content">
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">– Confucius</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The first lesson of economics is scarcity: There is never enough of anything to satisfy all those who want it.&nbsp; The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">– Thomas Sowell</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eManuluOCJQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">(Video)</a></span>. &nbsp;There seems to be an inordinate amount of discussion about ‘inequality’ in society, even though it focuses only on ratios of financial income between cherrypicked examples.&nbsp; When the social media hordes opine on this subject, there is often a comical inability to distinguish income and net worth.&nbsp; Even worse, when people in positions of power address the topic, there is a fixation on financial inequality, rather than the various other inequalities that exist between people (health and vitality, attractiveness, likeability, physical abilities, cancer susceptibility, communication skills, quality of relationships, the climate where they live, their commute, etc.).&nbsp; Why is the facile metric of financial income ratios between arbitrarily selected strata suddenly a dominant crisis of our age, when by most statistical measures, inequality is far less than it was for the majority of human existence?</p>
<p>The political push behind ‘inequality’ is mostly because monetary assets are the only possession that can be forcibly transferred from one person to another.&nbsp; If one person is much more attractive than another, amputating the former’s nose and grafting it onto the latter’s face as a second nose will make both of them much less attractive than they were before the operation, despite the ‘redistribution’.&nbsp; Sadly, the process of forcible wealth redistribution destroys wealth and social values with much the same effect.&nbsp; Proponents continually refuse to see the evidence of the failure of this system in country after country.</p>
<p>However, there is a different track of financial inequality that is more valid, and where the focus should migrate to.&nbsp; Now that money-creation by central banks has to become permanent and ever-rising, it is absolutely valid to complain about how QE money accumulates in the hands of extremely few people, who then may or may not spend it in a way that diffuses across the economy.&nbsp; The executives and shareholders of the largest banks, as well as the holders of US Treasuries and Mortgage Backed Securities, are disproportionate recipients of US QE, even ahead of other billionaires in other sectors.&nbsp; This not only is unfair, but after QE1, QE2, and QE3, the finite and diminishing effectiveness of this sort of very narrowly concentrated money creation was becoming more obvious even in 2016, let alone now.&nbsp; Therefore, in addition to being essential that newly created money be given to individuals, the DUES of central bank money addresses a large portion of the inequality&nbsp;debate, because what can be fairer than every US citizen receiving the same share of the required monetary creation?</p>
<p>Inequality is not best addressed by taxing the most productive, or by conflating assets with income, or by assuming that two people of the same income are equally prosperous if they are at very different stages of life and have very different obligations. &nbsp;The real inequality of this era is something quite different.</p>

<p><strong>The Real Inequality : &nbsp;</strong>There are many products and services available for little or no cost today, that were inaccessible to even the wealthiest person from a century ago.&nbsp; These examples are more numerous than people realize (such as the ability to research a topic online in a few minutes, vs. spending half a day at the library to mine various books for information).&nbsp; But as good as such examples are, they do not fully explain how different 2020 is relative to just two, five, or seven decades ago.&nbsp; There is a saying that comes up in futurism circles, which is that <em>“The future is already here, it is just not evenly distributed.”</em>&nbsp; Allow me to present my interpretation of what this statement truly means.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201b7c86ce56a970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e201b7c86ce56a970b img-responsive" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="CW1hlvSWoAAUu_v" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201b7c86ce56a970b-500wi" alt="CW1hlvSWoAAUu_v" /></a>This chart from Max Roser is a byproduct of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/2-the-exponential-trendline-of-economic-growth.html">earlier exponential GDP growth charts</a></span>.&nbsp; For most of human existence, the only occupations available to the bottom 99.9% of people were handicrafts, agriculture, construction labor, or military service (usually not by choice).&nbsp; Ordinary people often had to partake in very dangerous work just to earn basic food and clothing, while today the same necessities can be earned in an hour of work within a safe environment.&nbsp; Most individuals with very high IQs, deep musical or artistic talent, or exceptional innovative capacity never got a chance to see if they could earn a living from such aptitudes, if those attributes were even considered valuable at all.&nbsp; This is still true for the billion plus people who earn less than $2/day in the most destitute countries, and their condition is a window to what almost all humans lived like before modern times.&nbsp; Very few people have ever lived in a time and place where they had any chance to monetize their more exclusive, specialized talents.</p>
<p>Starting at the very top, we see that today, there are a select few people who earn over $10 Million per year in careers that could not have existed just a generation ago.&nbsp; Would Oprah Winfrey be a billionaire in any other time, or in most other countries, considering how many enabling factors of hers are exclusively contemporary?&nbsp; Would professional athletes not only earn millions from their sport, but additional millions by ‘endorsing’ products that they themselves may not use?&nbsp; Would musicians be earning millions in royalties for decades after their best songs are released, even from countries they have never been to?&nbsp; We can see that some people are extraordinarily fortunate to be born in the right time and right countries for their talents to be actualized, but what about the rest of us?</p>
<p>You may not be quite as supreme an extractor of modern opportunities as an A-list celebrity or self-made tech billionaire, and fame will always be finite in a way that wealth is not, but lest you think this concept is applicable only to those at the apex, take an inventory of your own career. &nbsp;Is your profession one that either did not exist a century ago, or otherwise pays much more than it used to, due to productivity-enhancing technologies?&nbsp; If you think the answer is no, consider how many of your tasks involve the use of MS Word, Excel, or Powerpoint (or equivalent non-Microsoft programs).&nbsp; Think about how often you communicate with a colleague who might be hundreds or thousands of miles away, via a medium that carries little or no cost of communication.&nbsp; Think about how often you travel, for business, to a country that your home country was at war with less than a century ago.</p>
<p>Now, think back to what professions your grandparents did, both your grandfathers and grandmothers.&nbsp; If you happen to have a grandfather who was an illustrious success, he is just one of the four, and is not representative of the dataset.&nbsp; If you don’t know what some of your grandparents did, they were almost certainly not in a profession that would be considered impressive today.&nbsp; Once you list out what all four did as their primary occupation (most of your grandmothers were housewives), consider how fortunate you are to be born just two generations later, where someone of the same genetics has such a better suite of career choices available to them.&nbsp; To broaden the dataset even further, consider all of your cousins who are common to these grandparents, and assess the professions they are in and their general prosperity levels.&nbsp; You will find an overwhelming rise in the variety as well as quality of professions between the two groups, over just two generations of genetically similar people.</p>
<p><em>Thus, the real inequality is not one of present income or some other shortsighted metric, but rather one of era.</em>&nbsp; Until recently, only a few skills could be monetized and rarely were they the person’s ‘dream’.&nbsp; In the modern age, a much higher portion of the workforce is able to utilize a wider range of their talents at higher compensation and with great safety.&nbsp; This, more than anything else, indicates how fortunate the vast majority of people in all but the poorest countries are, compared to their ancestors just two or more generations earlier.</p>
<p>Yet, it gets even better, as we circle back to the favorite subplot of this piece, that of exponentially rising prosperity.&nbsp; There are many products, services, and conveniences that are almost free today, but were inaccessible to even the wealthiest people of 40 years ago.&nbsp; Returning to the celebrated smartphone, the device that serves as your telephone is now wireless, and further serves as your camera, music player, calculator, geo-locator, alarm clock, and much more.&nbsp; The peasants earning just $4000/year in emerging countries now have a smartphone that is better than what anyone could have purchased in 2006, with the ongoing rate of improvement continuing to amaze.&nbsp; The same goes for many other types of electronic devices.</p>
<p>At this point, a critic will emerge who utters a memorized line like “people don’t eat computers and smartphones, so this progress is overrated”.&nbsp; This conclusion is incorrect, as the processes that create low-tech consumer staple products continue to become more efficient from the implementation of technological stardust.&nbsp; A few graphs from Prof. Perry’s blog depict the trend of price declines in some products that by themselves are low-tech consumer staples.&nbsp; Everything from <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.aei.org/publication/americans-love-to-complain-about-rising-food-prices-here-are-three-reasons-they-should-stop-whining/">food</a></span>, to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/clothing.png">clothing</a></span>, to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.aei.org/publication/todays-new-homes-are-1000-square-feet-larger-than-in-1973-and-living-space-per-person-has-doubled-over-last-41-years/">housing square footage</a></span>, to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/energy.png">energy bills</a></span>, to the cost to travel by either&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.aei.org/publication/the-cost-of-air-travel-in-the-us-has-been-remarkably-stable-for-the-last-decade-and-17-cheaper-than-20-years-ago/">airplane</a> </span>or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.aei.org/publication/oil-gas-prices-fall-historically-low-levels-good-time-reflect-marvels-market-julian-simon/">automobile</a></span>, has been dropping relative to average household income.&nbsp; Even if the end product is apparently low-tech, the processes that go into producing, delivering, and improving them continue to adopt the latest productivity-enhancing technology, becoming part of the ATOM.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a523b4cf200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20240a523b4cf200b img-responsive" alt="CarpeDiemCollage" title="CarpeDiemCollage" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a523b4cf200b-500wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a>Anyone of a certain age remembers when airline travel was only for the wealthy, cars broke down often and left oil slicks in parking spots, clothes deteriorated more quickly than today, and almonds and cashews were considered expensive for the average household.&nbsp; Most complaints about the inflation seen in basic necessities are either very selective or outright inaccurate, for in reality the price of most staples continues to decline.&nbsp; The only exceptions are invariably from products derived from industries that have concocted a deep entanglement with government to willfully obstruct market forces.</p>
<p>If all of this is not enough to demonstrate that a later a person is born, the more blessed they are with resources, luxuries, and branches in their life script, consider one particularly profound frontier of research – <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_extension">anti-aging and longevity</a></span>.&nbsp; While this is still a very distant prospect, serious observers agree that there is at least some chance for a longevity miracle treatment to emerge.&nbsp; People spend most of their lives coming to terms with the grim reality of their own finite lifespan, yet now there is the slim possibility that people born late enough might be able to readily reach ages of 100 or higher.&nbsp; Before long, we will see examples of older billionaires pledging most of their wealth towards longevity research in a desperate bid to turn back the clock.&nbsp; Meanwhile, a younger person with no money can simply wait until the treatment is mainstream and inexpensive, with little risk of cutting it too close.&nbsp; An extended lifespan may ultimately be no more than the random luck of having been born before 1970 vs. after 2000, with those in between on the fence.&nbsp; That, dear readers, is the ultimate inequality.&nbsp; Consider the misfortune of those who die just a year before some breakthrough longevity treatment.</p>
<p>Hence, the real inequality, affecting the greatest percentage of people, is one of era.&nbsp; The message here is not to depress those who were born a bit too early to have a realistic shot at living until the age of 100.&nbsp; Rather, that many discussions about inequality today are misguided, incomplete, and seem to be built around an agenda to forcibly transfer wealth.&nbsp; This is, in the age of Third Millennium Economics, an obsolete ideology.&nbsp; Under the hypothetical ATOM transition, when the DUES eventually crosses $50,000/year or more by the 2030s, the distribution of net worth will still not be very different than it is today, nor should it be, given the differences in effort, talent, and enterprise among individuals.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the greatest fortunes will be more tightly tied to entrepreneurship and innovation rather than embedded cronyism, while ordinary people operate from a much higher floor, with a wider range of choice and options than ever before.</p>
<p>This juncture is where the future starts to become more evenly distributed.&nbsp; We are at the point where early adoption of Third Millennium Economics begins to transition to mass-market adoption, if governments reorient accordingly.</p>

I always wondered.  When bailing out the banks in '08, why not just erase the mortgages of the home owners?  I'm not saying that taking on absurd levels of debt for an individual is wise (and then subsidizing these fools), but why not liberate those people from these problems so that they can continue to build something bigger and better?

Or simply sink the 1 Trillion dollars into new infrastructure (as in, new tunnels, bridges, etc.)  Better roads and countless new jobs.  Lehman Brothers can go die in a bush for all I care.

<div class="entry-content">
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The whole of science is nothing more than the refinement of everyday thinking. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">– Albert Einstein</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpXjdQ9rjec">(Video).</a></span> &nbsp;If these ideas enter mainstream US political debate, the entire landscape will be re-arranged.&nbsp; Many former allies will become adversaries, and vice-versa, in a shattering and reorienting of coalitions.&nbsp; This process will be much faster than the political class is accustomed to, since the speed inherent to Third Millennium Economics cannot be kept out of political processes for much longer.&nbsp; Count this as yet another long-overdue disruption that makes way for appropriate modernization.</p>
<p>A robust, entirely fair, and rapidly-rising safety net combined with an eventual income tax rate of zero is what is possible when the aforementioned checkerboard analogy is transformed and turned into a chessboard, where <em>all </em>squares are used.&nbsp; Society advances when both the left and right are competing to see who has better ideas, and where each side can admit when another had a good idea.&nbsp; I have always been a registered Independent and a ‘classical liberal’, and hence quite neutral in contemporary American politics, while being a co-blogger on both right and left-leaning blogs.&nbsp; But since it is the left that drives the political agenda in the US and with Republicans only reacting to the space that the left creates, I predict that of the two sides, I will be working with the Democratic Party to move these ideas forward.&nbsp; It is an exciting prospect to bring transformative ideas to the left, making long-sought goals of a guaranteed minimum income and deep safety net possible.&nbsp; This can lead to a return to the optimistic, can-do liberalism of yesteryear.&nbsp; This in turn improves the right as well.&nbsp; It is not an exaggeration to say that the decoupling of a robust, dynamic safety net from taxation may save democracy from itself.</p>
<p>With the general public, many types of petty property crime and financially-driven depression will greatly decrease, not just due to the stipend, but from the knowledge that it increases at a brisk rate each month.&nbsp; This is a significant alteration to the psychology of personal finance, and the relationship that people have with their own future-orientation hence adjusts favorably. &nbsp;While there will always be people who continue to squander all incoming money in addictions or mismanagement, there will be a wider gap between circumstantial and self-inflicted hardship.&nbsp; Simultaneously, about 50% of organized crime will also voluntarily vanish.&nbsp; An astute eye can catch subtle clues from various organized crime themed films and television programs, that most of the incentive for the rank and file criminals is the fact that their earnings are free of income tax (and thus twice as high).&nbsp; This is openly stated in programs like <em>The Sopranos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We can conclude that half of all such crime will voluntarily vanish when the 'tax-free' benefit is removed, due to the risk/reward analysis becoming that much less compelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>High-crime urban communities may get a major makeover with the injection of capital, creating a chance for new local business formation and social cohesion where there previously was none.&nbsp; The stipend creates a strong incentive for young people not to default into gang membership. &nbsp;Why risk an early death or incarceration when your stipend starts from age 18 and rises so quickly each year?&nbsp; &nbsp;This is where the DUES provides a compound solution across both urban ghettoes and withering rural towns with undiversified economies.</p>
<p>The stipend enables an unprecedented degree of economic mobility, evening out some location-chained economic distortions.&nbsp; Some lower-income Americans in expensive coastal cities might elect to relocate to smaller towns in the interior with much lower costs of living, and look for a job after arrival with the stipend bridging the gap in between.&nbsp; There is far too little research into how much an individual benefits from just a slight increase in their economic ‘leash’, which is what we will see here.</p>
<p>Depopulated locations with excess housing supply will see a new influx of settlers snapping up low-cost properties without an immediate need for employment.&nbsp; As enough of them arrive, their critical mass creates a new local economy to revive the area.&nbsp; Regional supply/demand mismatches of housing will even out, as jobs can emerge <em>after&nbsp;</em>the arrivals settle and generate economic activity.&nbsp; Another set of Americans may choose to relocate overseas to a country where the stipend stretches much further.&nbsp; A retiree couple earning two stipends could retire in luxury in Latin America, the Caribbean, or Southeast Asia, <em>with no worry about outliving their money</em>.&nbsp; Choices that seemed impossible become entirely attainable with the DUES, and the unnoticed burden of economic bondage is greatly reduced.</p>
<p>The middle class sees a phoenix-like resurgence from an elixir that addresses the poorly understood challenges they face, as the stipend is uncorrelated to their home equity, employment security, and mutual funds, <em>all of which decline at the same time during a recession</em>.&nbsp; The DUES, by contrast, keeps rising quickly even through a recession, indeed at an even faster rate than before if the recession features excessive deflation.&nbsp; This buffer reduces the pressure the unemployed face to liquidate their home or other assets at a low price during this period.</p>
<p>Schemes such as the mortgage interest deduction, ostensibly created to help the middle class, are actually detrimental to an unemployed person with no income to write off mortgage interest against.&nbsp; Such a deduction ends up widening the gulf between the employed and unemployed, and the removal of income tax altogether eradicates this hidden vulnerability (and resultant disincentive for entrepreneurship) in the process.&nbsp; Such an independent cushion through the Peace of Mind Dividend addresses the collective blind spot of what truly causes middle class duress in recessions.&nbsp; In accordance with Nasim Taleb’s concepts of fragility and anti-fragility, the middle class moves from an existence that is quite fragile in the face of rapid technological change, to considerably higher anti-fragility and true participation in the Third Millennium Economy.</p>
<p>Immigration to the US will automatically self-select for the highest skill levels since an immigrant, ineligible for the stipend, is at a structural disadvantage relative to US citizens in the job market.&nbsp; This disadvantage is inversely proportional to the skill level of the immigrant, until the immigrant becomes a citizen many years later.&nbsp; This solution thus addresses almost all of the complicated subtopics within the immigration debate at once, from the skill level of immigrants to the competitiveness of domestic workers in relation to recent immigrants, to even the geographic distribution of immigrants within the US.&nbsp; Most illegal immigration will stop of its own accord, since the illegal immigrant is not on a path to receiving a stipend and is uncompetitive in the labor market against stipend-receiving Americans.&nbsp; The stipend hence has ripple effects that repair the seemingly intractable topic of immigration (particularly skilled and legal vs. unskilled and illegal) with nearly perfect precision.</p>
<p>The DUES is particularly helpful to women.&nbsp; For one thing, women live a few years longer than men, so they collect more total funds over the course of their lifetime.&nbsp; Beyond that, there is much discussion about the tradeoffs that mothers incur in taking years off of their careers to have children.&nbsp; The DUES provides exceptional flexibility as a crucial buffer in these circumstances, as does the removal of income taxes, and thus the penalty on the second income that married couples face.&nbsp; There is also the topic of considerable intra-woman hostility from tax-paying career women towards benefit-receiving single mothers, even as individual circumstances vary greatly within both groups.&nbsp; The removal of income tax combined with an identical stipend for all adults irrespective of whether they have children substantially addresses the complicated nuances of fairness in such matters.</p>
<p>Not to be excluded, the wealthy experience a unique and invaluable form of relief from the need to organize their lives around tax efficiency.&nbsp; This frees their minds to focus on what they do best, which is to generate wealth, productivity, and jobs.&nbsp; The shameful yet ever-marketable myth that the wealthy have to lose before anyone else can gain receives a crushing blow when the linkage between taxation and the safety net is broken and the ‘make them pay their fair share’ bugbear evaporates.&nbsp; Furthermore, the aforementioned effect of improved working-class optimism from the DUES in turn diminishes the menacing threat of pitchfork sentiment directed towards the wealthy.&nbsp; This new climate where their employees retain their full pre-tax compensation and their customers have more spending money infuses all businesses with new energy and profitability.&nbsp; This, in turn, restores the reputation of free markets that the wealthy depend on.</p>
<p>The stipend program requires a negligible staff to administer.&nbsp; This slimming-down of many government bureaucracies and reassignment of staff to better positions provides a benefit to politicians as well, for now they can focus the Federal muscle on grander visions to finally take us to the 21<sup>st</sup> century we have been waiting for.&nbsp; High-tech infrastructure, a modernized space program, more funding for basic research, more elaborate startup incubators and entrepreneur grants, etc. are all areas that can receive greater focus than before.&nbsp; Some of the redundant employees from the entitlement program departments of government can find more soul-inspiring work in those agencies, as well as in the private sector, which will create far more jobs than the government sheds.</p>
<p>The technology industry, being a source of the ATOM itself, will benefit from the combined effect of multiple catalysts.&nbsp; When an entrepreneur has a guaranteed stipend that enables him to pursue some speculative venture without having to worry about basic necessities, and when the potential payoff is tax free, entrepreneurial activity rises tremendously.&nbsp; Startups will attract more employees for the same reason – more people are available for the uncertainty of startup life.&nbsp; Venture capitalists will fund a greater share of ambitious ventures, since the higher NGDP trajectory moves the risk curve back to what it was in the 1980s and 90s. &nbsp;Liquidity timelines for VC funds shorten from ten years back down to six, and the tax-free nature of all gains improves fund returns.&nbsp; Downstream, the linkage between mass-market demand and product innovation becomes more seamless. The technology paradox, where more technologically deflating devices in one’s life entails a rising cost of perpetually upgrading them, is a real imposition.&nbsp; This by definition requires that the wealth generated has to exceed the cost of aggregate upgrades across the majority of the population, for the last thing we need is a belief that the cost of upgrades is making people poorer.&nbsp; Read more <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.singularity2050.com/2017/04/the-upgrade-paradox.html">about the asphyxiating effect of the 'Upgrade Paradox' over here</a></span>.&nbsp; The DUES and tax phase-out allow this natural process to manifest, and for the virtuous cycle to proceed apace.&nbsp; All of these factors contribute towards moving the rate of technological progress back to the long-term trendline.</p>
<p>Beyond technology, various distortions in other sectors are ironed out.&nbsp; At present, the US economy has a huge bias in favor of products where the end consumer receives tax subsidies (such as higher education, mortgage interest, and healthcare) relative to those where they do not (such as consumer electronics and unprocessed food).&nbsp; This causes the subsidized industries to be low in innovation, while the unsubsidized ones are forced to be highly innovative.&nbsp; The removal of this bias will lift a considerable disadvantage borne by unsubsidized industries and their employees.&nbsp; Many monopolies and cartels will see an initial burst of profits as consumers simply buy more of what they have always bought, and this is where initial islands of inflation will form.&nbsp; But this widening of margin will attract greater competition and technological disruption, breaking many former fortresses of anti-competition after their initial surge.</p>
<p>Banks benefit from 230 million incoming monthly stipend deposits and the dramatic increase in transactions.&nbsp; Consumer goods companies benefit since they can now improve their revenue projections around the fact that their customers receive a stipend rising 16-24%/year.&nbsp; This larger and more durable market ensures greater dividends on R&amp;D expenditures.&nbsp; More adventurous products can be considered as the path to profitability has shifted, and product cycles are faster.&nbsp; In effect, all companies will be able to adopt some of the favorable economic characteristics of technology companies.</p>
<p>All of these sectors are components of the broader equity index, and the equity market will start to shift into a steeper trajectory, consistent with the accelerating and exponential rise in GDP.&nbsp; The index is further supercharged by the removal of corporate taxes alongside the boost in employee productivity from the removal of individual income taxes.&nbsp; A more steeply rising equity market and the absence of capital gains taxes accelerates the cycle of creative destruction and wealth creation further, tying into the earlier point about venture capital returns and liquidity/viability of new technology startups.&nbsp; Equity volatility, however, will not go down; it will merely seem as though time has moved into fast forward relative to today.</p>
<p>By contrast, the sector of finance that will have to be completely rethought is the bond market.&nbsp; On one hand, the DUES makes it far easier for lower-income but responsible borrowers to service debt, elevating a new cohort of borrowers and driving interest rates lower.&nbsp; On the other hand, the assumption that bond yields are a reflection of inflation has to change, given the 16-24% annual increase in the stipend.&nbsp; The removal of deficit spending will discontinue the issuance of new US Treasuries, which is a huge adjustment to capital markets.&nbsp; International debt markets will see an even greater overhaul, since some countries can start a DUES program sooner than others, creating many peculiar arbitrages.&nbsp; Perhaps the bond market, after serving international finance for so long, will have to shrink to fraction of its prior size and significance with municipal and corporate bonds the only remaining instruments.&nbsp; Bonds may no longer be seen as a hedging counterbalance to equities, due to the advent of the ATOM and the associated deflation.&nbsp; The appropriate yield on municipal and corporate debt per grade will have to arrive at a new equilibrium after accounting for all of these forces.</p>
<p>Overall, a vast range of enterprises, aspirations, and talent utilizations seemingly too unattainable before could now be closer to a threshold that warrants serious pursuit, simply because central bank perma-QE can separate the safety net from tax collection.&nbsp; The battles between taxpayers and recipients that occur in country after country, and that have claimed millions of lives over the centuries, can be greatly reduced, due to this new paradigm of monetary injection.&nbsp; This solution transcends both socialism and capitalism, making the inherent assumptions behind each obsolete.&nbsp; If the Sovereign Venture Fund is implemented instead of ATOM DUES, the economic transformation can be similar, as long as deployment of funds is done algorithmically and transparently, rather than through politicized opacity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The problem you're going to have with politicians is that progressives, most Democrats and some Republicans, think it is their job to tinker with society trying to create their vision of Utopia. This idea of giving everyone an equal stipend and leaving the rest to the free market is not going to go over well with a lot of them.

Occam's Stubble,

Perhaps.  The key is international competition.  In Chapter 10, I describe 4 candidate countries that can use their small size to their advantage and outcompete larger countries, while simultaneously proving the effectiveness of this approach.

As a millenial investor focusing almost solely on disruptive innovation, and politically a Marxist myself (it's complicated), I must say I agree with almost everything up until now -- and certainly agree on all the broad strokes and conclusions you've drawn. 

Not that my agreement is worth anything, of course. I just find it evocative that much of the same conclusions I've independently arrived to, as a result of reconciling my reformist Marxist and effective altruist inclinations, are non-trivially similar to your own. My assessments are infinitely less concrete, eloquent, backed up, verifiable, or convincing as yours, mind you, but I chalk that up to a wide dirth of age, experience, and obvious insight.

Also, you said "This solution transcends both socialism and capitalism," and I must add a caveat. I doubt you've read much Marx but it should be noted that there is resoundingly more similarity between his writings and conceptions, and what I've read of ATOM so far, than between that of the traditionally accepted economic explanations of neoliberals and the ATOM. Speaking not of his ideological conclusions and their dictats -- which arise from his economic model when paired with his psychology and cultural environment of the time and individual choices -- but purely of his full conception of historical materialism and his progression of human history through to capitalism and beyond.

The "and beyond" part pertaining to technological advancement and its impact upon capitalism especially, but certainly not exclusively.

I'm not joking nor exaggerating, but I must say I'm thrilled to have discovered such a salient overlap from such starkly different perspectives. I will certainly be re-reading Capital again after I finish reading the rest of the ATOM chapters, infact.

What is it with you millennial Marxists?  You are aware that the political system you espouse doesn't work?  I mean, not only doesn't it work over the last 100 years, but resulted in the deaths of 100 million people? Read Red Holocaust (2010) some time.  Or Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Koestler, Howard Fast, the Killing Fields....this has all been extensively documented.  It's not a matter of tweaking the system.  Every possible Marxist tweak was tried and failed. The idea you can "reform" such a catastrophically flawed theory is like someone claiming to be a reformed Nazi, or a reformed KKK member, or a reformed cannibal.  It's just..an odious concept.

No..the ATOM has nothing whatsoever to do with Marxism, and the concept that it does is utterly preposterous. Marx's economic models are laughable, and bear no resemblance to our modern economy. For example, Marx believed that under the Marxist paradigm, the state would wither away. Weirdly the exact opposite happens every time Marx’s thought has been tried in actual society. Marx was also a determinist, assuming people thought a certain way because of class.  And because of that people couldn’t be reasoned with. The problem is that if people can’t be reasoned with, they can and must be be bullied.

Worse still, he misunderstands capitalism.  In a nutshell, it is very simple - goods and services exist in finite quantities. How do we determine the best mode of distributing those goods and services?  Where is the greatest ROI? 
Capitalism sets up, essentially an auction.  Those that need or want the goods and services bid up the price.  That auction creates an emergent intelligence (AI) with the processing power vastly in excess of any individual.  Marxism assumes that people are making decisions - they are not making decisions any more than the cells in your brain are individually making decisions.  The emergent AI is making decisions.  Because ROI is maximized, ultimately, there is a vast increase in goods and services.  This increasing flow of goods and services is logarithmic.  2 becomes 4, 4 becomes 8, and so on. 

Marxist don't like the decisions the emergent AI makes, but being stupid Marxists, they have no concept that it is the AI calling the shots, not individual people. So they decide, heck, with better people making the decisions, everything will be better.  Unfortunately, individuals are not smart enough, fast enough, and don't have sufficient information, to make good decisions.  The ROI collapses, spectacularly.  Again, being stupid Marxists, they assume the cause of the collapse is saboteurs, Kulaks, whatever, and devolve into totalitarianism to prevent the mythical enemy from succeeding. That usually when the killing starts in earnest.

I expect, like most Marxists, you'll claim everything good is related to or predicted by Marx, and everything bad is somehow a corruption of Marx. Please don't waste anyone's time with such sophomoric pseudo-religious mumbo jumbo.  My other favorite Marxist excuse is "bad" people hijacked Marxism and humuna humuna it would work if we had better people in charge.  But that doesn't square with the emergent intelligence of capitalism which basically says no one is actually in charge, and putting someone, anyone, in charge is the main problem.

Thanks, Geoman, for your comment.

It is true that young people who believe in 'Marxism' want to fit everything into a binary designation of 'proves Marxism is good' or 'incompatible with Marxism', when the ATOM thesis actually requires a 0% income tax (and eventually a negative income tax for humans), which of course is the complete opposite of Marxism.  

Anyway, 19th century thought really can't grasp ATOM concepts, as there was just virtually zero actual data available from which to draw the appropriate conclusions.

Marx was a product of his own time.  He lived not all that removed from monarchism, from serfdom.  It's not even that his ideas were even wrong - just hilariously outdated. Like Lysenkoism.  

I apologize if I'm coming on too strong.

Geoman,

It is not too strong at all.  The amount of indoctrination happening in schools and universities is extreme.  

Everyone is talking about 'higher taxes' without any mention of tax complexity as the real villain.  Even the screeching about Trump's tax cut is over just a 2% cut.  In reality, the trend should be towards much bigger reductions, then 0%, then negative tax rates (also called ATOM-DUES).

You hit the nail on the head there - tax complexity. Flatter tax schemes with no deductions are actually much fairer to everyone involved, and cheaper to collect.  The flattest being some sort of VAT tax.  But the impulse to try and control the economy is too strong, so we generate a maze of deductions, exemptions, and favored status.

Oddly large corporations and Marxists are often allied in favor creating complex taxes, rules, and regulations.  Whenever you see a thick stack of regulations know that the largest players in the game all had a hand in crafting them, and did so with a purpose.

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>–&nbsp;</em>Gautama Buddha</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The problems in the world today cannot be solved by the level of thinking that created them.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>–&nbsp;</em>Albert Einstein</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQDSho9DGA">(Video)</a></span>. &nbsp;The problem in the US and other mature democracies is that new policy ideas do not advance at a faster rate than they did a century ago even though technology has accelerated the speed of many other economic and social forces.&nbsp; Compounding this problem is the reality that government adaptations occur only in reaction to crises that are already fully underway, with the recent coronavirus pandemic as just the latest example.&nbsp; They thus act from a position of panic and duress that leads to overshooting in the other direction.</p>
<p>The American Dream is in trouble, yet neither political party seems able to address why.&nbsp; While even the voters themselves are not demanding that the US government become more dynamic and proactive, there are a number of policy solutions that can pre-empt the calamity if so desired.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Third Millennium Economics Political Platform :&nbsp; </strong>US political thought has become exceedingly unoriginal, acrimonious, and tribally conformist, with many internal contradictions within both major parties.&nbsp; For example, people who consider themselves proponents of free-market economics generally identify as Republicans or Libertarians (even if Republicans are getting increasingly selective on this front), while people who consider themselves pro-technology generally vote Democrat.&nbsp; Yet, to me, these two things are absolutely inseparable from each other.&nbsp; So many cognitive dissonances have sprouted across US political discourse that the electorate and government will soon find themselves unequipped to interpret or even discuss upcoming challenges.&nbsp; The entire political universe is hamstrung by the two peculiar ideological apertures they are trained to parse information through.</p>
<p>The US political landscape has devolved into a metaphorical checkerboard, where only half of the squares are used for the two sides to wage war against each other, and the other half of the squares are unused and practically invisible.&nbsp; About half of all possible political and economic platforms are not even noticed within mainstream US politics, and people have been conditioned to think only within this box.&nbsp; This is especially true when a person’s political bonafides are determined by how completely they remain within a specific box, which itself has ever-sharpening boundaries.</p>
<p>Democrats talk about providing a greater safety net, a ‘living wage’, and greater ‘equality’, yet do not see the most effective path to these goals.&nbsp; They do not quantify a threshold that meets the standard of a ‘living wage’, after which success can be declared.&nbsp; Accordingly, they keep devising new ways of taxing the most productive people, thus reducing their incentives and thus the total productivity of the economy.&nbsp; This strategy is well past the point of maximum tax revenue because tax complexity ensures that any tax increase falls more on upper-middle-class people than the ultra-wealthy and their many avenues of legal tax avoidance that confer immunity to any increases in ‘retail’ tax rates.&nbsp; An increase in the 'retail' tax rate thus accomplishes little except build a moat around the ultra-wealthy, ensuring that members of the upper-middle-class cannot join their ranks.&nbsp; A cynic might conclude that this is deliberate protectionism for the ultra-wealthy, but I do not believe that was the original objective.&nbsp; Rather, individual loopholes are sold to specific groups by individual legislators in Congress, with no holistic oversight to control spiraling complexity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, while there is some merit to the concept of a guaranteed minimum income even if a person cannot earn that much from their own output, increasing the legally mandated minimum wage is emphatically the wrong way to accomplish that outcome.&nbsp; Such a law merely forces the employer, which is usually a small business or franchise with narrow profit margins and steep competition, to trim any staff that cannot produce enough to justify the new minimum wage.&nbsp; In this age, automation can quickly fill the gap and price out human workers from repetitive, lower-skill jobs, effectively making a minimum wage increase a subsidy for automation.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.aei.org/publication/ten-reasons-that-market-determined-wages-are-better-than-government-mandate-minimum-wages/">There are other reasons why obstructing the market from determining a minimum wage is misguided and costly</a></span>.&nbsp; If a guaranteed minimum income is to ever be a reality, it has to be funded from a source that does not have to operate under a tight profit-and-loss reality, and there is only one such entity in existence.</p>
<p>Republicans are equally infected with outdated ideas.&nbsp; The GOP dithers about lower taxes and more favorable policies for small business, but is oblivious to easier methods to accomplish this.&nbsp; While some people are more talented and harder working than others and should not be penalized for their productivity, it is simultaneously true that money created by the Federal Reserve accumulates in very few hands, thus making it very different from wealth creation via entrepreneurship.&nbsp; Furthermore, as discussed before, tax complexity wastes as much as 20% of all tax revenue just in compliance and auditing, without counting the even larger cost of suboptimal business decisions for tax reasons.&nbsp; Yet Republicans are not pushing for tax simplification, even though that would effectively be a larger and deeper supply-side stimulus than the tax cuts they propose.</p>
<p>One faction of Republicans are against QE by the Federal Reserve under the belief that this will someday, somewhere cause inflation that has not yet appeared for over a decade and counting.&nbsp; While that would have been true in the 20th century, it is no longer true in the third millennium, <a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/4-the-overlooked-economics-of-technology.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">for reasons discussed earlier</span>.</a>&nbsp; There is still a vocal but shrinking clique of individuals who think hyperinflation is imminent, and a return to the gold standard is necessary.&nbsp; These 'inflation hawks' have predicted about 100 of the last zero bouts of hyperinflation, and don't seem to be interested in reassessing their assumptions.&nbsp; $30T of central bank action over eleven years, with another $300B/month being added to that as of mid-2020 post-coronavirus, has not vindicated this expectation.&nbsp; We can safely declare that the burden of proving that inflation is inevitable is now theirs to bear, and they have yet to provide any evidence to support their blind belief.</p>
<p>If one cannot accept that monetary expansion up to a very high ceiling will no longer cause inflation, and indeed needs to be permanent and ever-rising just to halt techno-deflation, it will never occur to them to gradually fund government spending with central bank money instead of tax revenues.&nbsp; That is a shame, since this is a path towards the goal of vastly reducing and eventually even eliminating all Federal income tax and fostering a huge economic stimulus, specifically favoring entrepreneurship to an unprecedented degree.</p>
<p>But within the respective blind zones of the two parties lies the most magnificent and elegant solution.&nbsp; In reality, we are now in an era where both Democrat and Republican goals can be met and exceeded with ease and simplicity, leaving many difficult tradeoffs behind as relics of the pre-ATOM age.&nbsp; I fully predict that by 2025, this solution will seem obvious in hindsight, despite the reflexive opposition by the ivory tower of the PhD Economists.&nbsp; Allow me to explain.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201bb09105ec9970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e201bb09105ec9970d img-responsive" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Payments to Individuals" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201bb09105ec9970d-320wi" alt="Payments to Individuals" width="348" height="257" /></a>For one thing, the relationship between the American people and the Federal government is not what it used to be.&nbsp; A number of seemingly innocuous changes to the US legislative branch of government in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century set in motion a mechanism that had large ripple effects over the next century.&nbsp; A succession of tax-and-redistribute programs were created to address current or future poverty, but without holistic oversight, each new program was not sufficiently complementary to existing programs.&nbsp; This led to many contradictory spending outlays, bureaucracies, and incentives.&nbsp; At this stage, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.aei.org/publication/entitlement-nation-the-federal-government-has-gradually-turned-into-a-gigantic-wealth-transfer-machine/">75% of all spending by the US Federal Government comprises of payments to individuals,</a></span><a href="https://www.aei.org/publication/entitlement-nation-the-federal-government-has-gradually-turned-into-a-gigantic-wealth-transfer-machine/"> </a>particularly if politically engineered non-essential jobs of a make-work nature are counted.&nbsp; Unfortunately, even after all the wastage in the tax collection process, there is another gauntlet of rebound wastage within the disbursement process.&nbsp; When you combine this fact with the reality that government spending substantially exceeds tax revenues, the perversity of this situation becomes apparent.&nbsp; The number of voters who are net recipients of these handouts and entitlements is at or near a majority of the electorate, so there is political profit in talking about tax increases, even as it is politically impossible to trim these handouts.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: right;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e202c8d3b63af3200b-pi"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_United_States_federal_budget"> </a><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: right;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e202c8d3b29361200c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e202c8d3b29361200c img-responsive" alt="Budget" title="Budget" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e202c8d3b29361200c-500wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_United_States_federal_budget">In Fiscal 2019, the United States collected $3.5 Trillion in taxes and spent $4.4 Trillion</a></span>, resulting in a budget deficit of $0.9 Trillion.&nbsp; Remember that this will shoot to as much as $2 Trillion during the depths of the next recession, including the brief coronavirus recession.&nbsp; It is already a moral hazard to spend more than is collected in taxes, but since 75% of this $4.4 Trillion, or $3.3 Trillion (96% of taxes collected), consists merely of transfers of money between individuals, it does not finance any direct governance function.&nbsp; Many of these programs have heavily-staffed departments to administer them, and have complicated formulae and qualification criteria that determine payments.&nbsp; Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the ACA, welfare, unemployment compensation, food stamps, housing subsidies, alimony and child support enforcement agencies, etc. are just some of these programs, many of which are contradictory and non-interlocking with each other.&nbsp; As a result, a significant fraction of the funds disbursed are consumed in the processing of applications and payments.&nbsp; Even worse, there is a substantial band of income where non-interlocking policies have entrenched perverse incentives.&nbsp; For example, a person with no income qualifies for Medicare, but income above a certain cutoff disqualifies the person from the benefit without the earnings being high enough for the person to cover the costs by themselves.&nbsp; Hence, by increasing their income, their actual income goes <em>down</em>.&nbsp; This induces many people to avoid employment, as employment makes their healthcare affordability go down.</p>
<p>But what if I told you that now, for the very first time, we have the ability to implement a solution that will not only fund a very efficient, fair, and dynamic safety net, while making the tax code far more favorable to entrepreneurship, productivity, and corporate employees all at once?&nbsp; It would have been too good to be true even as recently as 2008, but through the wonders of technology, it no longer is.&nbsp; If the first solution seems 'too good', we even have a second-choice solution that is still a huge improvement over what we have now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First Choice : The Universal Stipend as a Multi-Solution</strong> <strong>:</strong> &nbsp;Since central bank monetary expansion has to now be permanent, rise at compounded growth rates closer to Moore’s Law-type concepts than the 1-2% inflation rates, and can no longer involve buying some asset classes over others, there is really only one solution to this malaise.&nbsp; That is, if the legislatures of the largest economies can untether their central banks to make this possible.</p>
<p>After estimating how much money can be created to keep NGDP in the 6-7% range, simply disburse that new money directly to the people in a uniform, equitable payment.&nbsp; That is the most diffuse and fairest way for central banks to halt inflation and create a broader, smarter safety net, and is the most effective way to offset technological deflation.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is more scalable and confidence-generating (‘carrot’) than negative interest rates (‘stick’).</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201b7c86ce53b970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e201b7c86ce53b970b img-responsive" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Old and New" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201b7c86ce53b970b-500wi" alt="Old and New" width="438" height="662" /></a>More specifically, we can introduce the Direct Universal Exponential Stipend (DUES), where every US citizen over the age of 18 (230 million people at present) gets an equal share of the Federal Reserve monetary expansion.&nbsp; If such a program were hypothetically implemented in the United States of 2020, my calculations estimate that it would amount to about $5,000 per eligible person for the year.&nbsp; Every US citizen is eligible to receive it, and everyone gets the same amount.&nbsp; Whether rich or poor, young or old, lazy or industrious, male or female, childless or with a large brood, every citizen adult gets the same amount, period.&nbsp; The stipend also has to be exempt from Federal income taxes, and incoming payments cannot be garnished by creditors or bankruptcy courts.</p>
<p>Now, given the rapid and accelerating rate of technological change, consider the possibility that the DUES can rise each year at a speed much faster than the annual increases normally associated with inflation or ‘Real’ GDP.&nbsp; The steep gradient of increase in worldwide central bank monetary expansion discussed earlier fully demonstrates that the necessary amount to be created in the US itself rises by an estimated 16-24%/year.&nbsp; For this reason, the stipend rises by the same amazing rate, parsed into compounding monthly increments.&nbsp; The Federal Reserve determines the monthly increase by gauging indicators like the MIT BPP, and then publishes the exact increase before the start of the next calendar month.</p>
<p>The stipend can take a couple of months to ramp up to $400/month (say, $100, $200, and $400 in months 1, 2, and 3), so as not to create a small inflation spike from the sudden V.M. jolt.&nbsp; From there, it can then settle into the aforementioned cruising speed of approximately 1.2%-1.8%/month increases (16-24%/year), calculated dynamically in accordance with real-time inflation data.&nbsp; A hypothetical $5,000 in 2020 rises to about $6,000 in 2021, then about $7,200 by 2022, and so forth as the payments compound.&nbsp; As this is money generated by the central bank as cash, it does not need to be recorded on any balance sheet.</p>
<p>We, as a nation, have reached the point where the vast majority of government spending now comprises of payments to individuals, and we recognize that it is politically impossible to reverse this.&nbsp; Simultaneously, the amount of monetary creation needed to halt technological deflation is rising exponentially, and there does not appear to be an easy fix to the fact that technology creates both vertical (skill level) and horizontal (specialization) skill mismatches in the workforce.&nbsp; So why not embrace all of these realities?</p>
<p>The second half of the idea now arrives with a certain inevitability.&nbsp; Since most of this government spending can be replaced with money that has to be generated just to offset deflation, we can proceed to, in a phased and orderly manner, eliminate all types of Federal Income Tax.&nbsp; Yes, you read that correctly.&nbsp; It logically follows that when the primary purpose of income taxes is to make payments to individuals, and the DUES supersedes current payment programs, there is simply too much economic upside to be captured by removing both the filing/compliance burden plus income taxes themselves.&nbsp; Monetization of government spending has been taboo in eras past (see Friedrich Hayek), but that was before technology and the associated deflation was substantial enough that permanent, exponentially-rising easing was needed just to offset it.&nbsp; Like so many worthwhile ideas, it was simply ahead of its time.</p>
<p>This transitional process should be gradual enough to seamlessly let the ATOM advance to a sufficient size, and thus is expected to take about 10 years.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/6-current-government-policy-will-soon-be-ineffective.html">As described earlier</a></span>, the biggest problem with the tax code is not just the tax progressivity, but also the multiple categories that income has been divided into, known as ‘character’ for tax purposes.&nbsp; As the phase-out is conducted, issues like tax complexity begin to vanish as the concept itself becomes moot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, we should pause to catch our breath.&nbsp; This solution may seem very sanguine, but the individual components of it appear to be drifting in this direction already, particularly after the coronavirus pandemic forced a huge volume of new monetary creation, that too in a form that is edging towards direct payments to people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Releasing $1.15 Trillion/year and rising in an economy of $22 Trillion may seem like a bit too much, but that is where the trend of cumulative QE against the deflationary force of technology has already brought us.&nbsp; As explained before, this 6% and rising of GDP in newly generated money, distributed in a method that generates a tornado of VM, will still result in inflation of just 2-3%/year within NGDP of 6-7% a year.&nbsp; It indeed is the minimum needed just to halt technological deflation, especially since central bank money flows across borders quite seamlessly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually, world central banks will have to coordinate with each other to synchronize total monetary generation to world GDP.&nbsp; Note that the phase-out of income taxes will also generate a wave of one-time deflation that has to be offset.&nbsp; Until the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://bpp.mit.edu/usa/">MIT BPP annual inflation measurement</a></span> (or equivalent measurement, if you don't like the official CPI) pierces 3% inflation and threatens to dance with 4%, there is absolutely no reason to fear inflation or worry about the amount of monetary easing being excessive.&nbsp; Even that rate of inflation merely means the next year’s rate of increase will be a few percentage points lower, perhaps just 15% instead of 16-24%, but still an increase.&nbsp; The precise number does not need to be very accurate for any one year, for as the self-reinforcing mechanism builds, continual adjustment to economic feedback steers us to the correct numbers over time.</p>
<p>Critics may point out that this is just another ‘basic income guarantee’ or ‘living wage’ program.&nbsp; On the contrary, the DUES greatly transcends that, since those other ideas involve impossibly high taxation, whereas the DUES is simultaneous with a removal of income tax.&nbsp; Furthermore, the DUES is not an aid program, but rather a pure win-win through the self-reinforcing feedback loop, without which the payout is not possible in the first place.&nbsp; The fact that the DUES adjusts for inflation and rises exponentially are added elements of difference.</p>
<p>Finally, we can note that the upside of this approach goes well beyond just statistics and fiscal calculations.&nbsp; To truly grasp how many problems are addressed and swept away by the DUES of central bank money and corresponding tax phase-out, we have to delve deeply into the intricate psychology of hardship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The ‘Peace of Mind’ Dividend : </strong>The curve of human suffering is very non-linear.&nbsp; Deprivation of the most basic necessities is a cause of misery and distraction, and as we <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.techsectorweb.com/2-the-exponential-trendline-of-economic-growth.html">saw earlier</a></span>, only in the last few decades have a significant percentage of humans been elevated above this layer of existence.&nbsp; Yet even in 2020, at least 2 billion people worldwide do not have the very basic necessities, and while this aggregate number continues to drop, the progress remains very uneven.</p>
<p>At the other extreme, if a very wealthy person sees their wealth double, or conversely fall by half, very little about their living standard will change.&nbsp; When leftists see this, they conclude that wealth should be redistributed, since the destitute person’s suffering can be greatly alleviated with no real pain to the wealthy, resulting in less net hardship overall.&nbsp; As mentioned earlier, despite the initial appeal of this meme, such redistribution almost never works as intended and ends up shrinking the total economic pie.&nbsp; <em>Any real attempt to tax the wealthy instead taxes the upper-middle-class that cannot access sophisticated tax-avoidance structures.&nbsp; </em>This taxation thus has a negative multiplier effect on productivity without collecting much incremental tax revenue.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the poverty discussion is the failure to fully understand the differences, as well as similarities, between the poor-country-poor, and rich-country-poor.&nbsp; This leads to one-size-fits-all approaches that do not help either group.&nbsp; The former suffer from malnutrition, while the latter are more likely to suffer from obesity.&nbsp; The poor in wealthy countries have access to amenities that even the rich in poor countries do not, such as reliable electricity, paved roads, and emergency response services.&nbsp; Yet even those who point out the benefits available to the poor of developed countries fail to recognize the true burden on the human condition.&nbsp; This is an angst common to poor-country-poor, rich-country-poor, and even many people who are not poor at all.&nbsp; We know of this as <em>hopelessness.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Hopelessness with one’s life and prospects, in a psychological sense, is a state of purgatory where someone truly believes there is nothing to look forward to, nothing that can uplift their current condition, or nothing that can alleviate their despair.&nbsp; It is a terrible scourge on the soul, and is often the reason for depression and suicide (consider that a country as prosperous as the US nonetheless still <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_in_the_United_States">has over 45,000 suicides per year</a></span>, a number which has failed to shrink from economic growth).&nbsp; It is also the primary reason that people with seemingly normal lives decide to join fringe hate groups or terrorist organizations.</p>
<p>Hopelessness is a huge weight on the economy, social mood, and individual well-being.&nbsp; Hopelessness is a menace just as familiar to the man in Bangladesh earning just $1000/year who worries about his children’s malnutrition as to the working class American earning $50,000/year who can barely accumulate any savings while seeing his industry replace jobs like his with AI.&nbsp; Even people who are wealthy and famous experience hopelessness for any number of reasons (some celebrities loved by millions of fans have committed suicide, after all, and often for reasons related to a bleak and uncertain financial outlook).&nbsp; Furthermore, stress and despair are major contributors to both cancer and heart disease, which are the two most frequent causes of death in developed countries.</p>
<p>While nothing can eradicate every source of human hopelessness fully, implementation of the annual guaranteed stipend will do a great deal to ease the ongoing anxiety of working class people about their employment and their savings.&nbsp; Knowing that the stipend they receive continually rises by 16-24%/year while the price of their essentials does not mitigates the uncertainty factor by providing optimism about their future financial safety net, retirement income, and ability to service debt.&nbsp; This in turn boosts consumer confidence and sparks more entrepreneurial risk-taking.&nbsp; Knowing that the stipend is independent of one’s employer is another major relief to one’s financial outlook.</p>
<p>Many of the arguments in favor of a minimum guaranteed income and more generous safety net correctly emphasize the savings this may create elsewhere in the economy in terms of lower crime and higher consumer confidence.&nbsp; But all of these ideas involved taxing productive work to a prohibitive degree, and providing money based on some convoluted assessment of neediness that often ends up incentivizing laziness and government dependence.&nbsp; This solution, by contrast, merely takes the large and rising money stream that the Federal Reserve has to perpetually create anyway to halt deflation, and use it to replace the 75% of government spending that is just direct payments to individuals.&nbsp; Since every eligible US citizen over age 18 gets the same amount, it is entirely fair, and the richer a person is, the less this will remove their incentives to produce.&nbsp; Almost all wealthy people continue to work long past the point where their living standards can no longer improve further, and this will not change.&nbsp; Excluding the top 1% of earners from the stipend will only increase the stipend for the other 99% by 1%, making this layer of complexity more trouble than it is worth.</p>
<p>This can be termed as a ‘Peace of Mind Dividend’.&nbsp; If this program is implemented, the pervasive boost in economic confidence will be an immense catalyst to the economy, particularly as the stipend rises due to the deflationary effect of the ATOM.&nbsp; While the hypothetical $5,000 payment in 2020 does not seem significant, the estimated 16-24% annual increase in monetary expansion required just to offset deflation means that the stipend could be over $12,000/year by 2025.&nbsp; It will still keep on rising every year after that, from an ever-higher base.&nbsp; Remember that a couple gets two such stipends into their household.&nbsp; If elderly parents live with their married children, then such a household receives four incoming stipends.</p>
<p>Finally, the stipend provides a sense of <em>participation</em> in the high-tech economy to all US citizens.&nbsp; Instead of the gains of technological progress seemingly a distant and esoteric concept for the other 80% to 90% of Americans, a stipend that grows quickly for reasons known to be associated with technological progress has subjective ripple effects.&nbsp; It accomplishes a great deal in educating the general public about the accelerating rate of technological change, how productivity flows from technology, and how many fruits are available to them to pick if they know where to look.&nbsp; AI will no longer be seen as a job-swallowing scourge, but rather as the engine that keeps the stipend rising, which in turn reduces the opposition to productivity gains inherent to anti-AI sentiment.&nbsp; The value to the masses of this sort of participatory education and orientation towards welcoming new technologies should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Allowing the Economy to Breathe from <em>Both</em> Lungs, For a Change :&nbsp; </strong>Above and beyond this, the gradual elimination of income tax is an incremental and meteoric boost to personal wealth and consumer spending, for people at all income levels.&nbsp; Being inured to tax withholding via their W-2 and then lulled by a direct deposit to their bank account, not many workers have pondered how much more their employer spends on them relative to what they receive in their pockets after all taxes.</p>
<p>Since most well-paying jobs are in states with very high tax rates, the marginal tax on every dollar earned by workers there rapidly crosses 50%.&nbsp; When a person is hired into a job that supposedly pays ‘$120,000/year plus benefits’ in official paperwork, the employer has to spend about $175,000/year for the employee to receive $80,000/year after all taxes, not even counting the time spent by both parties on tax compliance.&nbsp; When you consider this, it is surprising that there are even as many employed people as there are.&nbsp; When income taxes are phased out for individuals and corporations the scenario above will be one where an employer spending $175,000 leads to as much as $150,000 being retained by the employee, inclusive of all benefits.&nbsp; There will be many more jobs created in such a climate as well, since the same example could lead to an employer splitting the position, i.e. spending $175,000 to create two junior jobs where each employee retains $75,000.</p>
<p>It is obvious how much of a boost this would provide to consumer confidence, consumer spending, and debt serviceability.&nbsp; Beyond that, when the marginal output of the most productive workers goes from 50-55% taxation to 0% taxation, their workplace enthusiasm and supererogatory productivity will rise by an astonishing degree.&nbsp; This will have a magnificent cascading effect across every imaginable metric of economic health. &nbsp;The entire culture of work and productivity will change, across all industries and every level of expertise.&nbsp; Complaints about wage growth recede away, while employers have a wider range of tools at their disposal to align compensation with incentives.&nbsp; It is scarcely possible to overstate how much improvement both employers and employees will see across every aspect of corporate culture.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.aei.org/publication/lower-tax-rates-may-nudge-top-inventors-to-move-between-countries-and-scientists-to-move-between-us-states/">There is considerable evidence that innovators and entrepreneurs flow to where the top marginal tax rate is the lowest</a></span>.&nbsp; Some will cite Silicon Valley as thriving amidst high taxes and heavily regulated building permits.&nbsp; I counter (with my 25 years in residence) that Silicon Valley’s success is <em>in spite </em>of the business unfriendliness of the public sector, combined with the fact that the ultrawealthy of Silicon Valley pay almost no income tax due to loopholes available to them that are concealed by tax complexity, as described earlier.&nbsp; Imagine how Silicon Valley could vault higher with lower taxes on startups and individuals, and with the DUES backstopping the living expenses of young entrepreneurs.&nbsp; Countless business models large and small that are unviable under current taxation become viable, and existing businesses will enjoy margin expansion, which in turn leads to more innovation and competition in each space.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the elimination of corporate tax will unshackle the $2 Trillion in cash that US blue chips still have parked overseas in order to indefinitely defer the taxation of those funds, even after the early 2018 reduction in corporate tax rates.&nbsp; It is often written how US job creation would increase if these offshore profits were brought back home, and the removal of the perverse incentive that keeps this money stashed in tax havens will alleviate a huge burden on both corporations and workers.&nbsp; Since all capital expenditure has a quicker payback timeline through the faster compounding of returns without taxation, capex can increase, which means product lifecycles can speed up.&nbsp; This erases the aforementioned problem of low NGDP and the ill-effects that flow downstream from it.</p>
<p>At this point, two common points are invoked by skeptics.&nbsp; The first is the speculation that such a stipend will merely create a leisure class out of the bottom 60-80% of the population, who spend their lives immersed in various types of home entertainment.&nbsp; They may do nothing else with their time and do not set good examples for their children, who then fail to grow into productive innovators that sustain the ATOM.&nbsp; Putting aside the fact that such a concern is mutually exclusive with worries that AI will leave millions permanently unemployed, or that healthcare costs are surpassing affordability, it is unfounded in any event.&nbsp; Since the incentives on productivity, entrepreneurship, and innovation are tremendously higher than ever before, the entire curve of return on investment/labor/risk shifts to a more favorable zone.&nbsp; The absence of income tax will not only lead to much higher pay for the same job, but a greater quantity of jobs than could have come into being under the more oppressive tax code.&nbsp; In addition, customers of each business have more money to spend, generating greater revenue for any business they buy from, and thus more jobs in those companies, some of which generate new technology, expanding and reinforcing the ATOM.&nbsp; The ‘sloth class’ will in fact be much smaller than it is at present once this virtuous cycle is permitted to manifest.&nbsp; Various dysfunctional subcultures will vanish of their own accord through a form of societal autolysis.</p>
<p>The second group of skeptics consists of those who do a basic calculation to discover that under this rate of increase, the ever-rising stipend will cross $100,000/year by the early 2040s, meaning that every US adult gets for free what few Americans in 2020 can capture post-tax even from full-time work.&nbsp; They contend that this surely cannot be a serious prediction due to the law of large numbers alone, and if nothing else, this will cause inflation.&nbsp; But if you refer back to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/2-the-exponential-trendline-of-economic-growth.html">earlier charts about exponential and accelerating economic growth</a></span>, the trendline deposits us at exactly a point where such a stipend and growth rate (now driving the NGDP growth rate itself to that level) is well within the band.&nbsp; The second derivative of the curve cleanly indicates that the next 20 years may see the same multiplier of geometric increase as the previous 80-100 years, making such numbers consistent with the trendline.&nbsp; Remember that AI advances hundreds or thousands of times faster than humans, and will by then be generating tens of trillions of dollars of annual output with very little input; output which humans can consume.&nbsp; Add to that the fact that as per the ATOM diffusion rate established earlier, technologically deflating products may be as much as 8% of world GDP by then.&nbsp; It all combines into a robust yet simple refinement of economic governance with the exponentially rising growth of the ATOM.</p>
<p>This is not to claim, in any way, that recessions and asset price crashes will never happen again after such a complete revamp of economic, fiscal, and monetary realities.&nbsp; To the contrary, the gregarious groupthink of human nature ensures that such dips become inevitable after a certain period of time.&nbsp; What will happen, however, is that the peaks and troughs of each business cycle will be along the much steeper growth trendline.&nbsp; This also means that the old definition of a recession – two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, will continue to become more outdated, since even the troughs of the cycle may have positive, albeit below-trend, growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Second Choice : The Sovereign Venture Fund :&nbsp; </strong>If DUES seems like too drastic an overhaul of the entire fiscal and monetary system, there is another solution for how the central bank monetary creation can be used to uplift an economy without changing fiscal flows.&nbsp; While not as comprehensive and broad in its effect, it still can bring immense improvement to the lives of a country's citizens.&nbsp; This solution is the Sovereign Venture Fund.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This solution is exceptionally simple, as I wrote about <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.singularity2050.com/2018/04/a-country-specific-solution-for-technological-competitiveness.html">in April 2018</a></span>.&nbsp; It is simply about capturing the rest of the world's technological deflation for domestic benefit, which by definition means that the country that executes the vision first gets all the benefit.&nbsp; Any country with an advanced economy and its own central bank can qualify, and the dollar size of the Venture Fund can be the same no matter how small the country implementing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it is always better to be a prosperous country than an impoverished one, almost every small country (the size of Canada or smaller) is faced with a major vulnerability in the modern economy.&nbsp; Their economy invariably depends on one or two major industries, and is hence vulnerable to a technological disruption that arises from somewhere else in the world.&nbsp; The need to diversify against such external risks is obvious, but most countries are not on the best path to achieve this goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These days, everyone I meet from the government of some foreign country seems to have the same goal for their country - to create an ecosystem of local technology startups.&nbsp; This goal is not just extremely difficult to attain, but it is very misguided.&nbsp; Technology is becoming increasingly governed by winner-take-all dynamics and capital concentration, which means even in the US, rival cities are unable to compete with Silicon Valley.&nbsp; Silicon Valley itself has concentrated into a smaller portion of the San Francisco Bay Area than was the case in the late 1990s, with the bulk of new wealth accruing to a group of around just 7000 people within which there is relatively little turnover.&nbsp; Small countries with technology sectors, such as Israel and Singapore, started decades ago and have a number of unique factors in their favor, including a major Silicon Valley diaspora.&nbsp; Hence, a country that thinks it is productive to create a tech startup cluster in their countries will almost certainly create a situation where young people receive training at local expense, only to leave for Silicon Valley.&nbsp; So these initiatives only end up feeding Silicon Valley at the expense of the original country.&nbsp; Even if a few tech startups can be forcibly created in the country, it is extremely unlikely that they will achieve any great size within even 15 years.</p>
<p>Take, for example, a country like New Zealand.&nbsp; It has many favorable characteristics, but certain disadvantages as well in an increasingly globalized economy.&nbsp; It relies on agricultural and dairy exports, as well as the film industry and tourism.&nbsp; It is too remote to easily plug into the well-traveled routes of tech executives (less than 30M people live within 3000 miles of New Zealand) or major supply chains.&nbsp; It is too small to be a significant domestic market for tech (particularly when a functional tech ecosystem has to comprise of startups in multiple areas of tech in order to achieve rudimentary diversification).&nbsp; New Zealand's success in getting Hollywood films shot in New Zealand cannot similarly translate into getting some Silicon Valley business, as an individual film project has a short duration and distinct ending, with key personnel on site for just a brief period.&nbsp; Technology, by contrast, is inherently endless, and requires interdependency between many firms that have to have co-location.&nbsp; Furthermore, no society is capable of placing more than 1-2% of its population into high-tech professions and still have them be competitive at the international level (most tech innovation is done by people in the top 1% of cognitive ability).&nbsp; For this reason, a tech startup ecosystem does not create broad prosperity (it is no secret that even within Silicon Valley, only a fraction of people are earning almost all the new wealth.&nbsp; Silicon Valley has among the most extreme inequality found in any advanced economy).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned above, it is difficult for government officials, legislators, and statesmen to undertake the drastic steps of DUES implementation, particularly when the entire Economics profession, as described before, is still mired in outdated thinking about how QE will someday, somehow cause inflation.&nbsp; For this reason, a second, less drastic option is also available for New Zealand.&nbsp; That involves create what I describe as a <strong>Sovereign Venture Fund</strong>, where the&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_New_Zealand">New Zealand Central Bank</a></span> creates a segregated account that is completely partitioned off from the domestic economy, and prints money to place into that account (say, $500 Billion).&nbsp; It is crucial that this money <em>not circulate domestically at first, as it would cause inflation</em>.&nbsp; The purpose of this $500B Sovereign Venture Fund is to invest in startups worldwide that might be disrupting New Zealand's domestic industries.&nbsp; This model is extremely effective and flexible, as :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i) The money was not taken from New Zealand taxpayers, but rather generated for free by the New Zealand Central Bank.&nbsp; Hence, it can invest in speculative startups across the world with far more boldness.</p>
<p>ii) The diversification achieved is immediate, and can always be adjusted with equal immediacy as needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>iii) The Fund is leveraging the rest of the world's technological deflation for New Zealand's domestic benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>iv) Tech startups worldwide become extremely vocal advocates for the fund, and even the country itself.&nbsp; It boosts New Zealand's branding (generating even more tourism).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>v) Fund gains can be used to offset government spending by replacement of income tax, or to fund training to enable citizens to modernize their skills.&nbsp; It can also provide a greater social safety net to cushion industries buffeted by disruption, but without taxing those who are still working.&nbsp; This is how to repatriate the money without inflation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>vi) Even a larger fund of $800B can earn $80B/year from a 10% return, which exceeds the total taxes collected by the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Sovereign Venture Fund is an extremely effective, speedy, and versatile method of economic diversification.&nbsp; It can be customized for any prosperous country (for example, an oil exporter should simply invest in electric vehicle, battery, and photovoltaic technologies to hedge their economic profile).&nbsp; As a huge amount of worldwide QE has to be done just to offset technological deflation, there is no contribution to inflation even worldwide, let alone domestically.&nbsp; As the winds of technological change shift, the Fund can respond almost immediately (unlike a multi-decade process of creating a tech startup ecosystem only to worry if the sectors represented are about to be disrupted).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since there is a very high and exponentially rising ceiling of how much world QE can be done before world inflation reaches even 3%, there is an immense first-mover advantage that is possible here.&nbsp; The first $1 Trillion is effectively 'free money' for the country that decides to be Spartacus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>New Zealand, in particular, has even more factors that make it a great candidate.&nbsp; The NZ$ is currently too strong, which is crimping New Zealand's exports.&nbsp; This sort of program may create a bit of currency weakening just from the initial reaction.&nbsp; For this additional reason, it is a low-risk, high-return strategy for generating a robust and indeed indestructible safety net for New Zealand's citizens, hedging them from the winds of global technological disruption.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Maintaining the Third Millennium Economy :&nbsp; </strong>For this self-reinforcing feedback cycle to work best, the enabling factors of the ATOM have to be stewarded.&nbsp; While this system is more robust, self-correcting, and decentralized than any existing system, it is not entirely immune to neglect, abuse, or political corruption.</p>
<p>In the political sphere, this new, yet permanent and rising tide of ‘free money’ will test the principles of even the most frugal of fiscal hawks, because the money is not ‘free’, but a dividend that continues through the adequate care and feeding of the (worldwide) ATOM.&nbsp; An unrestrained political class may squander this bounty in various shortsighted grabs.&nbsp; Examples include quadrupling military purchases of expensive new weaponry, doubling the number of staffers and aides attending to each high-level official, or making a vote-buying campaign pledge to pay women a larger annual stipend than men.&nbsp; Collective self-control by both the citizenry and leaders in these matters will determine which nation stays competitive relative to others, in the third millennium.</p>
<p>Excessive and/or outdated regulation quietly suffocates innovation, and the regulatory regime has to upgrade to a new rubric compliant with the speed and effervescence of technological change.&nbsp; When the economic pie grows due to lower taxation and higher velocity-of-money, the most zealous regulators may see the newly created space as an opening for vast increases in regulatory complexity, and the accompanying empire-building.&nbsp; The topic of correcting obese or ill-structured regulation is beyond the scope of this paper, but it is worth mentioning that despite the consolidation of many government programs and departments, the regulatory regime may greatly inhibit the full potential of this system if not subject to independent oversight.</p>
<p>Industries that operate as cartels and monopolies may be the origins of occasional inflation spikes, which provide fuel to critics and can cause lasting damage to the entire philosophical underpinning of the program.&nbsp; While most monopolies will eventually break from the disruptive pressure the ATOM exerts on them, the interim phase can easily be misinterpreted through an anti-technology lens.&nbsp; The regulatory regime must also be wary of not letting the innovators of yesterday become the anti-innovation monopolies of tomorrow, for this impedes the ATOM and reduces the DUES growth rate, or the speed at which the Sovereign Venture Fund can take new central bank capital.</p>
<p>While the stipend itself will automatically generate considerable education about technological change as a matter of course, that alone is not sufficient.&nbsp; Retraining programs to enable workforce transitions have to be far more extensive than they are today, with an associated cultural shift.&nbsp; It should be expected that at any given time, 10-20% of adults are in some level of retraining even if they currently have jobs, as the churn of creative destruction endlessly remakes the economy.&nbsp; Professions and industries on the brink of disruption have to be identified early in the process, so that the retraining of individuals can happen proactively.</p>
<p>The above maintenance requirements are minimal given how much other complexity is removed in this system.&nbsp; But the human brain is often resistant to change, and has a bias in favor of the status quo, even if inferior.&nbsp; The stipend is the key buffer in the process of cushioning human anxiety while transitioning society to this new age.</p>

T.S.,

It is obvious that America already pays a large fraction of the population to do nothing.  

The DUES is an improvement since it is combined with 0% income tax and no disincentive to work (today, many people deliberately keep their income low so as to remain on welfare).  A 0% tax rate greatly increases the incentive to do productive work.

If the government (not the FED) issues the money there is no debt. I think this is preferable to the FED. Is there a moral hazard to government issuing money? Yes. But there is also a moral hazard to bankers issuing money. And they charge interest for the privilege.

"An unrestrained political class may squander this bounty in various shortsighted grabs.  Examples include quadrupling military purchases of expensive new weaponry, doubling the number of staffers and aides attending to each high-level official, or making a vote-buying campaign pledge to pay women a larger annual stipend than men."

Why do you believe that governmental policy will light upon a universal flat stipend rather than any of the (call me cynical, but I believe) far more likely above possibilities?

Stipends are definitely possible, but I can see them being distributed very unevenly, just as they are now in order to appease specific interests, rather than some force necessarily creating incentives to make them equal.

I can see the rhetoric now regarding the last item in particular: "Women disproportionately bear the burden of parenting and housework." "Every year, X thousand women are beaten by their partners.  Support the Strong Woman's stipend so that we can give these women the support they need to escape their abusive circumstances."  Then just depict a universal stipend as funding layabouts and criminals.  Oh, also support legislation B that removes the stipend from anyone convicted of a crime or misdemeanor etc etc.

Are you proposing some specific system to ensure that the thing that's happened to <i>all the handouts we already are capable of giving</i> doesn't happen to these ones?

Yes, politicians will push for this.  Hence, the country that can fight off such politicization will outperform those that cannot.  The ATOM DUES program greatly tightens the competition between countries, you see.  The uniformity of it will expose many fraudulent statistics and memes more easily than is possible at present.  

It is harder to socially engineer when the entire flow is much simpler, and there is a lot less smoke and mirrors to hide behind.  

<i>Are you proposing some specific system to ensure that the thing that's happened to all the handouts we already are capable of giving doesn't happen to these ones?</i>

The wholesale elimination of many departments is necessary.  Since this is politically impossible in the US, see Chapter 10 about how it has to start in some smaller countries first, before any larger country can be considered.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URfIizig6AM">(Video).</a></span> &nbsp;We are finally in a time where insufficient awareness of the accelerating rates of technological change and economic growth has tangible costs to governments and the citizens under them.&nbsp; The incorrect approach can lead to deflationary crises, while the correct approach can monetize this acceleration to a degree that lifts all boats.&nbsp; Continuing with legacy economic, fiscal, and regulatory policies in an era where the ATOM is now more advanced is analogous to continuing to feed baby food to a person who has long since outgrown it and now requires an adult diet.</p>
<p>Most of the next section is specific to the United States, but other developed countries face most of the same circumstances, and require very similar solutions.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Everything About the Current US Tax Code is Problematic : </strong>The current US Federal tax code involves layer upon layer of taxes and exemptions that were each enacted without sufficient holistic assessment of how the new provision fits into the existing tax code, since each was a secret favor purchased through lobbying.&nbsp; The outcome is a labyrinthine morass of esoteric gobbledygook that combines the worst of all worlds, and greatly obstructs the US economy from creating jobs to the extent that it is a miracle jobs are still being created.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, consider the tortuous filing and collection process.&nbsp; The tax code has layers of contradictory types of taxes, and a vast range of loopholes and legal shelters to avoid each of those types of taxes for those wealthy enough to hire the appropriate tax lawyers.&nbsp; There are so many such loopholes that some have only three attorneys in the entire country specializing in that particular tax structure, each charging five-digit fees or higher to create the structure.&nbsp; Add to that the practice of private rulings, where a particular person can petition the IRS for a specific case interpretation unique to that individual and unusable by anyone else.&nbsp; This reaction to tax complexity is against the grain of uniform laws.&nbsp; As a result, not only has it become impossible to tax the very wealthiest people, but the cost of compliance with such a complex tax code itself <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/tax-compliance-cost/">wastes billions of hours of productive time each year</a></span>, amounting to as much as 20% of the tax ultimately collected.&nbsp; This should be the easiest aspect of the tax debate on which to gain consensus, yet it is the least discussed.</p>
<p>But that is just the beginning, for once a person or corporation figures out what they owe, the tax code itself is structured such that the most productive work of all is what precisely falls under the most onerous taxes.&nbsp; The United States has one of the most progressive (i.e. top-heavy) income tax codes in the world, and it has become even more progressive in recent times, with talk of skewing that even further.&nbsp; The tax code is at the point where even slight increases in tax rates invariably crushes productivity by a disproportionate magnitude, particularly when a state or local tax rate rises independent of any assessment of where that fits in relation to the Federal tax obligation.&nbsp; Whatever you tax more, you get less of, and productivity is far too precious to be taxed at the current rates of up to 55% for higher income people in California, New York City, and other higher-tax localities.&nbsp; These locations attracted the highest taxation because they also happen to be the greatest fountains of potential productivity.</p>

<p>The next problem is the Social Security tax, which unlike the progressive payroll tax, is <em>regressive</em>.&nbsp; The employee and employer jointly pay 12.4% of the employee’s salary up to a cap of $137,700 in 2020, as an additional tax, split equally between the two.&nbsp; As this is combined with ordinary income tax, it creates a series of peaks and valleys that complicate what each additional dollar of income will be taxed at.&nbsp; If both ordinary income tax and Social Security Tax are flawed, then levying the two of them in tandem is even more counterproductive than either by itself.&nbsp; While the employer pays half of this for an employee (resulting in the salary being accordingly reduced), a self-employed person pays the full tax himself.&nbsp; The fact that this is yet another separate category of taxation, against which some deductions that may apply to other income do not apply, adds even yet more to the nightmare.&nbsp; Lastly, if you thought you were finished, you are really only at the midpoint, for you now have to do an entirely new process to see if your income is compliant with the second tax code, the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).&nbsp; After you do both calculations, then you pay the higher of the two.&nbsp; All of this results in a situation where the ‘published’ tax rate and actual tax rate are widely divergent, and force too many decisions to be based on tax optimization, which in turn become suboptimal decisions for growth.</p>
<p>Finally, lest anyone think their income is not, and will never be, high enough for tax complexity to affect them, remember that employers have to file corporate tax returns, so these costs reduce the number of jobs they can create.&nbsp; It is logical to conclude that an unemployed person with no income bears a huge cost of tax complexity, simply by the hidden viscosity consuming the resources potential employers may have used to hire an employee.</p>
<p>Now, I am going to extend sympathy to a group of people that no one else extends sympathy to – the Internal Revenue Service.&nbsp; What is overlooked by the public is that the IRS has to enforce a tax code that is given to them by the US Congress, which, over time, has become a humanly impossible job.</p>
<p>Congress makes endless modifications to the tax code for purposes ranging from political reciprocity for wealthy donors, to electorally-geared rhetoric designed to court a target demographic.&nbsp; The IRS has very little input into these modifications, yet the IRS nonetheless has to enforce the ever-mutating tax code given to them.&nbsp; The President and Congress may authorize an increase IRS staffing, but even this is deep into the zone of futility, because as the complexity of the code rises, the number of auditors needed does not rise in proportion, but rather as a <em>square</em> of the complexity increase.&nbsp; If the code becomes twice as complex, it takes four times as many examiners to audit all returns, ensuring that complexity can eventually surpass any realistic staffing increase or improved training of examiners.&nbsp; Additionally, a tax expert who is extremely well-versed in important parts of the tax code can earn a seven-digit income by working at an elite law firm or as the head of tax strategy and structure for a large, multinational corporation.&nbsp; The IRS has little chance of hiring or retaining the few such experts that exist while bound by government salary grades.&nbsp; AI is not the solution to the processing of tax returns either, as any AI significantly more advanced than TurboTax will keep arriving at the conclusion that the tax code itself is the bottleneck to productivity.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the cumulative frictions of tax complexity and excessive taxation of productivity are a huge burden on all workers and entrepreneurs, yet hard for the public to visualize as there is no window into an alternative universe of simple, light taxation.&nbsp; We may be accustomed to this code, but the effect on the US economy is analogous to forcing a person to breathe with only one lung.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Conventional Wisdom on Monetary Expansion is Flawed :</strong> &nbsp;As of 2020, there are two fundamental problems with the way the Federal Reserve has created money over the last decade to offset deflation, the source of which is still not being correctly attributed to technology.&nbsp; The first problem is the belief that each round of QE will be the final one.&nbsp; The second problem is that it is done in a very indirect and convoluted way that disproportionately concentrates the QE money in very few hands.&nbsp; This current approach to expansion leaves the US economy unequipped to deal with the next major recession and financial crisis.</p>
<p>In the US, the Federal Reserve creates money by purchasing treasuries of various maturities, as well as mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), and holding them on the balance sheet.&nbsp; The purchase of treasury debt by the Federal Reserve enables the US Government to lower the interest rate on the debt it issues, so that it can spend more than it collects in taxes.</p>
<p>The belief that the assets will be sold back has induced a selection that only the most credit-worthy buyers would prefer (namely the US, Chinese, and Japanese governments, and the largest banks), hence concentrating purchases in just these assets.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this sort of artificial reduction of yields favors two asset classes – real estate and the equities of the largest corporations through share repurchases financed by issuing corporate debt.&nbsp; If we exclude the effect of international monetary expansion on US assets for the time being, we can see that no other asset type is nearly as equipped to convert Federal Reserve bond buying into price increases.&nbsp; So these two assets rise and fall in price in direct tandem with monetary expansion, while other formerly correlated assets underperform.</p>
<p>Above and beyond the unsustainable distortion that occurs by producing QE money in such a narrowly concentrated manner, monetary expansion with the overt goal of inflating asset prices is itself an ineffective and unsuitable tactic for uplifting the prosperity of average people.&nbsp; In fact, it makes average people much more vulnerable to short-term market volatility than ever before, which creates a long-term milieu of anxiety.</p>
<p>The problem, in a nutshell, is that about 80% of the American population simply does not have the ability to accumulate a substantial net worth (say, several years of living expenses in liquid assets).&nbsp; To accomplish this requires a diverse set of character traits and skills, such as portfolio management, business-cycle awareness, advanced tax code knowledge, deferred gratification, and the utmost importance of having more than one stream of income.&nbsp; It is quite unfair to expect all households to be savvy to these various factors that determine net worth, especially when nothing of this sort is taught in the formal K-12 school system.&nbsp; This toolbox of skills is uncommon, which is why we often see people with high income yet little or no net worth, even if they weren’t flamboyant spendthrifts; they just could not sidestep the recession properly.</p>
<p>For this reason, inflating the prices of a few select assets is not the way to improve working class, middle class, and even upper-middle-class prosperity.&nbsp; It does not even benefit all wealthy people, but merely the small fraction of those who happen to be positioned closest to the central bank monetary spigot.&nbsp; This greatly muddles the picture regarding whether a fortune was generated via entrepreneurship or just the connectedness of a crony.&nbsp; While there are sporadic popular protests against entities disproportionately accumulating QE money, this situation is not yet receiving as much populist ire as it soon will.&nbsp; This is because the other asset class being inflated, real estate, has lulled the average household into a stupor of complacency sustained by the vapors of their home equity gains.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The US is in a Real Estate Trap : </strong>Conventional wisdom has beatified the status of residential real estate as an absolute must for anyone who can remotely manage to purchase it; an asset class that somehow transcends mere financial properties to become an indicator of a person’s self-worth.&nbsp; To question the sacred article of faith that a home always rises in value can get you socially blacklisted, even after the 2008 real estate bust.&nbsp; Some of this stems from the fact that until a century ago, land-owners were citizens with many special privileges (such as voting rights) unavailable to the landless.&nbsp; This made real estate the most visible demarcation of social class, and even the basis of many surnames.&nbsp; Old beliefs are durable, and even people who readily accept that commercial real estate is governed by the same economic fundamentals as other asset classes nonetheless insist that the addition of a kitchen and bathroom(s) somehow exempts the property from the invisible hand of market forces.&nbsp; For this reason, residential homes have become deeply entangled in the politics of economic conditions, and in turn, with the Federal Reserve’s monetary actions.</p>
<p>Decades of marketing has manipulated the emotional aspect of home ownership to convince Americans that they ‘own’ a house even if they have borrowed 80% or more of the price under relatively inclement legal terms.&nbsp; In reality, one only owns the dwelling they occupy if the mortgage payments are completed and 100% of the property is owned by the occupants, for if a mortgaged house misses a couple of payments, the mortgage holder will soon discover how few ownership rights he truly has.&nbsp; Furthermore, most US single-family homes are constructed from materials that deteriorate after about 50 years, a reality reflected in the tax code for commercial real estate depreciation schedules.&nbsp; This precludes the possibility of the structure itself rising in inherent value.&nbsp; In addition, nonpayment of property taxes can lead to liens on the home, and outright forfeiture, even if the amount owed is a small fraction of the home’s value.&nbsp; Despite all this, the aura of emotion that surrounds home ownership endures.</p>
<p>But as finance evolved, mortgages have been securitized, and bond yields are being managed by the Federal Reserve.&nbsp; Home prices generally rise and fall with the S&amp;P 500, removing the perceived relative stability that real estate is believed to have, particularly if it is leveraged, as most homes are.&nbsp; This means that real estate no longer represents diversification, as a person’s stock portfolio and home decline in value at the same time as when their employment is at higher risk.&nbsp; Both situations are exacerbated by insufficient NGDP, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/4-the-overlooked-economics-of-technology.html">as described earlier</a></span>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Federal Reserve, in lowering mortgage rates through the purchase of long-term Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), is specifically seeking to inflate just one type of asset class and hope that buoys the entire economy.&nbsp; The problem is, any action that increases home <em>prices simultaneously triggers the construction of new homes, thus increasing supply. </em>&nbsp;Hence, any government action to boost home prices is like trying to fill a sieve with water.</p>
<p>Now that mortgage rates are have been at historic lows for many years (often under 3% today vs. 8% in the early 1990s), the one-time boost that home prices can get from rate declines is already incorporated.&nbsp; There is very little room for any further price gains from lowering of interest rates.&nbsp; Add to that the fact that property taxes are now as high as mortgage payments in many locations, and the exhaustion of rate-lowering as a technique to inflate home prices becomes even more obvious.&nbsp; Additionally, demographic factors are moving unfavorably towards housing.&nbsp; The imminent retirement of baby boomers and shortage of new first-time buyers (due to a combination of youth unemployment, exploding student loan debt, and a falling marriage rate), means that sellers will outnumber buyers for the first time since data collection began in the late 1940s.&nbsp; Overseas buyers are not numerous enough to affect the total US market, as they concentrate on a handful of specific locations.&nbsp; This is a situation that has never before been seen in the United States since detailed data collection began in 1948.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">For these reasons, the current style of monetary policy is near the end of its efficacy.&nbsp; Under current trends, all housing-centric Federal Reserve action accumulates where it is needed the least, namely Silicon Valley and Manhattan, at the expense of the other 95% of the country's homes.&nbsp; No amount of further bond and MBS purchases by the Federal Reserve will be able to manage an orderly unwinding, since those approaches are effectively of a ‘fighting the previous war’ nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>The Federal Reserve is Cornered :</strong> To review the previously established concepts, the Federal Reserve does not have to overcome just one ideological barrier, but five.&nbsp; The needed paradigm shifts are :</p>
<ul>
<li>Monetary expansion has to be permanent and declared as such, instead of one-off programs tied to an assumption that each one is the final round of Quantitative Easing. Actual increases in the Fed Funds rate will be very-short-lived.&nbsp; Ironically, Japan and the EU are already in a mode of de-facto perpetual monetary expansion, even though the US pioneered the idea.</li>
<li>The Federal Reserve balance sheet can be retired, as the assets held on it will never be resold back into the market, and no such expectation needs to be sustained. The expectation itself has contributed to QE exclusively purchasing US Treasuries and MBSs, rather than riskier assets where the economic effect would have a higher multiplier.</li>
<li>World money creation has to rise at 16-24% a year, possibly higher, to offset technological deflation and keep the Wu-Xia Shadow Rate in step with the size of the deflationary force.</li>
<li>It matters relatively little which country’s central bank commences a QE-type program, as the liquidity effect quickly flows across the rest of the world if the program is diffuse enough.</li>
<li>Therefore, despite international monetary action, US programs can no longer be concentrated in just Treasuries and MBSs. They have to be of a more direct, diffuse, and permanent nature.</li>
</ul>
<p>If that were not enough of a summit to scale, the powers of the Federal Reserve are defined by Congress, and an expansion of Federal Reserve power will surely be a tough sell to the Senate and House at this time. &nbsp;Even if the majority of Congress were amenable to such a broadening, there may be Constitutional Amendments involved.&nbsp; Hence, the debate and legislative drafting process could be lengthy and hostile, and will only be expedited when a crisis is already underway.&nbsp; Barring a political miracle, the Federal Reserve will not be granted the powers to generate money with the versatility and precision to alleviate the next storm.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Federal Budget No Longer Has a Buffer &nbsp;: </strong>The current fiscal and monetary policies have created a distinct if uneven economic recovery, with the job market and S&amp;P 500, as of 2020, both having improved to an extent not seen in decades.&nbsp; Unfortunately, many of the measures taken have only delayed certain inevitabilities.&nbsp; The current pattern of government spending has increased the debt levels to a point where there is no longer the customary buffer to cushion against the next disturbance.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e202c8d3b1a60d200c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e202c8d3b1a60d200c img-responsive" alt="Deficit" title="Deficit" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e202c8d3b1a60d200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e202c8d3b1a606200c-pi"></a><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e202dad0c580c4200d-pi"></a>At the peak of the 1990s economic cycle, there was actually a brief budget surplus as high as 2% of GDP from the unexpected surge in tax receipts from the equity boom of the era.&nbsp; The subsequent recession caused the customary revenue crash and hence a deficit.&nbsp; The peak of the next business cycle, in 2007, had a deficit of -1% of GDP.&nbsp; Observers considered this to be acceptable, but at the peak<em>, there needs to be a surplus</em>, if only to offset the deficit on the next recession.&nbsp; Sure enough, the crisis of 2008-09 saw huge deficits.</p>
<p>Writing this in early 2020, many of the classical indicators are pointing to us being at or near the cyclical peak.&nbsp; Yet, the deficit is still -4% of GDP.&nbsp; Key figures in the government consider this to be good, just because the deficit has been going down from the extreme depths of 2009.&nbsp; But for the deficit to be -3% during the best years of a business cycle, even after three rounds of QE, is quite alarming.&nbsp; How deep will the deficit be during the next crisis, given that the deficit is already so much higher than it was in 2007?&nbsp; Comparing peak years of each cycle is the only appropriate ‘apples-to-apples’ comparison, which people will soon be reminded of.</p>
<p>The chart indicates that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has projections for the next ten years.&nbsp; Apparently the expectation is that there will be only tightly managed deficits that cling to the long-term average, even though recessions see steep deficit explosions as tax revenue falls.&nbsp; What, exactly, about the last two recessions provides any reason to believe that the next 10 years will be so controlled?&nbsp; If the deficit in the best year of the business cycle is -3% of GDP, there is every reason to think that this is a continuing patterns of lower lows <em>and</em> lower highs.&nbsp; A deficit that surges to unanticipated heights has manifold perils, most importantly the reduction of tools available to the government to hasten a recovery.</p>
<p>It is not that the people at the CBO are incompetent – they are just trying to do their job as best they can.&nbsp; The problem is that the primary prerequisite of a recession is the elapsed time since the previous recession.&nbsp; This induces too many people, including government budgetary forecasters, to forget the periodicity of recessions, and become complacent.&nbsp; When that is combined with the other factors we have discussed, such as accelerating technological deflation, inadequate methods and continuity of monetary expansion, and the cornering of real estate as an asset class, the implications are ominous.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Crisis Narrowly Averted Many Times :</strong> &nbsp;As Nasim Taleb has explained in his books <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447211449&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=antifragile"><em>The Black Swan</em></a></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/0812979680/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447211449&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=antifragile"><em>AntiFragile</em></a></span>, policies that aim to micromanage the smaller risks in a complex system greatly increase the risks from major events.&nbsp; This is unfortunately the situation that many governments have created today.</p>
<p>All of the aforementioned troubles continue to be postponed by increases in world monetary creation by one of the major central banks.&nbsp; I had originally thought a crisis could start in 2017, but the efforts of readers and myself to send notes to the US Federal Reserve caused them to reverse their ill-conceived tightening and resume monetary creation, delaying the problem but not fully doing what is necessary to shift macroeconomics into the third millennium.&nbsp; It became apparent the only way to avoid an eventual crisis completely <em>is either a paradigm shift in monetary creation to be more diffuse and exponential, or a massive decrease in regulation and tax complexity, preferably both</em>&nbsp; Barring this, the potential financial crisis was set to be at least as severe as the previous one (2008-09), and has the added obstacle of being resistant to the type of liquidity actions that worked in the previous instance.&nbsp; To fully illustrate how severe the situation may be, we have to consolidate the looming factors, which in combination are greater than the sum of them individually.</p>
<p>1) The central banks of the world are collectively not creating money in a manner that diffuses broadly, or in a quantity and permanence that keeps inflation and NGDP synchronized with the exponential growth of the ATOM.&nbsp; Hence, world monetary expansion in 2020 is still running at less than half of the estimated $400 Billion/month needed under by that point <em>just to keep up with the level of technological deflation.</em>&nbsp; Technological progress always finds a way to revert back towards the long-term trendline.&nbsp; Since the rate of change has been below the trendline for so long, perhaps the reversion necessitates enough technological deflation to force a severe correction in the financial markets.&nbsp; Such a correction will frighten central banks to crank up the monetary presses until deflation is overcome and the ATOM has sufficient fuel.</p>
<p>While the crisis can be avoided by rapidly changing the style and amount of QE as per the above, remember that central banks are not yet even close to thinking in terms of exponentially-rising money creation, even though this era is already well underway.&nbsp; I cannot overstate how quickly and seemingly without warning an exponential trend can overtake an inadequate linear policy solution.</p>
<p>2) US home prices are reaching a long-term ceiling barring an entirely new stream of wealth creation, given that mortgage rates are so low that property taxes are a larger annual expenditure than mortgage interest.&nbsp; Further Federal Reserve purchases of bonds and MBSs are now past the point of diminishing effect in boosting home prices.&nbsp; Yet policymakers and the real estate industry still do not appear to have any new paradigm that the baton can be passed to, and will be caught unprepared for the end of this era and the complex ripple effects of it.&nbsp; Since home equity has been the sole source of net worth gain for many middle-class people, this stagnation will be problematic for consumer confidence.</p>
<p>3) US National Debt is now over 100% of GDP, and the budget deficit is much higher than it was at previous business cycle peaks in 1999 and 2007.&nbsp; This leaves the US without the fiscal buffer that has mitigated recessionary deficits in the past, ensuring that the upcoming crisis has deeper deficits than the 2008 crisis.&nbsp; Additionally, this makes the US vulnerable to debt downgrades at precisely the time that tax revenue is crashing and sentiment is weakest.</p>
<p>The US National Debt is not high at all in relation to the present value of future GDP under the accelerating economic growth rate <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/2-the-exponential-trendline-of-economic-growth.html">discussed earlier</a></span>, nor are the annually accumulating budget deficits that created it.&nbsp; Alas, since current fiscal and monetary assumptions do not account for this, the current debt situation is ominous given how institutions and individuals may react to frightening headlines during the upcoming recession.</p>
<p>4) In 2020, the median baby boomer is 65 years old.&nbsp; A person’s contribution to GDP is very unevenly distributed across their lifetime, and when baby boomers were at the age of buying homes and starting families during 1982-99, the economy enjoyed that tailwind.&nbsp; Now, the same cohort is older and ramping down their consumption en masse, so a corresponding and proportional economic headwind is emerging, without enough young people to offset it.&nbsp; This additionally means that the number of recipients of Social Security and Medicare is about to rise, while the number of taxpayers is not rising, exacerbating point 3) above.&nbsp; While this effect does not manifest all at the same time, it is a force soon to exert additional downward pressure on the GDP growth trajectory, making the recession deeper.</p>
<p>5) China’s Nominal GDP in 2020 is now $15 Trillion, or about 70% of what US GDP is.&nbsp; This will mark the first time in 75 years that there is any other country with an economy that remotely approaches the size of the US economy, with the added certainty of retaining that status permanently.&nbsp; That such a large economy emerged so quickly, is far further along in Third Millennium Economics monetary policy thought, and via a system substantially different from that of any of the G7 economies, will cause the tectonic plates of the world economic order to shift somewhat, as the assumptions underlying many valuations get revised.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with that, but the process will add some untimely volatility to markets already convulsing from the first four factors listed above.</p>
<p>These five factors are converging into a dark cloud on the horizon, and while every detail of the crisis cannot be predicted, the general script is emerging.&nbsp; The most unanticipated challenge with the upcoming crisis will be that the levers used to alleviate the pain of the 2008 crisis will be futile this time.&nbsp; Even worse, markets that feel they are at the mercy of politicians rather than economic or technical forces are particularly prone to volatility.&nbsp;&nbsp;While waiting for the political process to catch up, real estate could once again crash, sending millions of homes hurtling into negative equity.&nbsp; This will lead to several million jobs lost, widespread panic, and some violent social unrest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Coronavirus Pandemic as a Warning Shot : </strong>The coronavirus pandemic and resultant quarantine was a version of black swan event that exposed many flaws in the outdating thinking across the Federal Reserve and government.&nbsp; Since the quarantine necessitated the freezing of entire sectors of the economy, the stock market plunged 40% in a matter of three weeks.&nbsp; The Federal Reserve, which was still vastly behind in its understanding of how to keep the economy afloat under such circumstances, reversed their tightening stance and, on the momentous day of March 15, 2020, lowered the Fed Funds rate to from 1.5% to 0%, and embarked on a new wave of QE, as described in Chapter 4.&nbsp; Yet, they still were far too afraid of non-existent inflation to send money directly to people, despite this being the only obvious mechanism to assist people during a mass quarantine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the rest of the Federal Government was even less enlightened, and decided to involve large banks and the Small Business Association (SBA) as middlemen between all stimulus and the citizenry.&nbsp; Their 'Paycheck Protection Program' had so many qualifiers and conditions that it was useless for most small companies, plus the program itself did not seem to care about entrepreneurs who are not taking a salary, or unemployed people.&nbsp; The program was obviously devised by people with no concept of what life is like for small businesses, free lancers, or anyone else not employed by the government or large institutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, the big banks just granted the stimulus funds to their biggest clients who, by definition, needed the money the least, while small, innovative companies and their employees were left to die.&nbsp; Even worse, the Small Business Association is an agency far too small and insignificant to manage the orderly disbursement of $1 Trillion within a matter of weeks, and the shambolic failure of their execution led to a mass misallocation of funds.&nbsp; By contrast, the IRS program to send $1200 to low-income taxpayers was efficient and painless, with over 50 million payments sent within days of announcement.&nbsp; Congress and the White House made the error of adding a layer of complexity by disqualifying taxpayers with incomes over $80,000, but this was still a far smaller problem than the total failure of the SBA and big banks.&nbsp; Furthermore, the IRS demonstrated an advanced transmission mechanism where money could be sent to virtually all households quickly, and is thus a channel the Federal Reserve could interface with if they wanted to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the dust settled, the biggest corporations were making more money than even before the crisis started, the stock market was at all-time highs, while thousands of innovative small companies and millions of freelancers and small-company employees were in dire straits.&nbsp; Aside from the relatively praiseworthy IRS program, every other government action helped exactly who needed it the least.&nbsp; This problem will continue to exacerbate under the current conceptual framework the government and Federal Reserve cling to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, much of this can still be avoided if swift implementation of certain comprehensive augmentations is executed.&nbsp;&nbsp;My mission is to present potential solutions, derived from my proprietary research (available to suitable clients), and get as much exposure to these ideas as possible.&nbsp; The summary of the solution detailed in the next few chapters is that the amount of worldwide monetary action needed just to halt deflation will be as high as $800B/month by 2024, and has to rise at 16-24%/year thereafter.&nbsp; Additionally, this money has to be distributed in a diffuse manner, going directly to individuals.&nbsp; The crisis can still be avoided if all of these upgrades are enacted immediately, but the probable failure to do this will precipitate the aforementioned crisis.&nbsp; Over time, this perma-QE can replace many types of government spending, and hence the taxes that fund such spending.&nbsp; For details on how I arrive at this set of recommendations, read on.</p>
<p>While I am under no illusion that policymakers will read, debate, refine, and implement the ideas presented here in time to prevent a new crisis even if there is a lot of grassroots support, the following solutions may nonetheless resemble policies that are fast-tracked in the midst of the turmoil.&nbsp; These solutions may thus become entrenched programs in the era following the crisis.&nbsp; <strong><br /></strong></p>

Additionally, demographic factors are moving unfavorably towards housing.  The imminent retirement of baby boomers and shortage of new first-time buyers (due to a combination of youth unemployment, exploding student loan debt, and a falling marriage rate), means that sellers will outnumber buyers for the first time since data collection began in the late 1940s. 

According to Bill McBride from Calculated Risk, demographics trend will be improving in the US in the next few decades. Can you comment?

Bill McBride says that the number of working-age people is now rising.  That does not mean that they automatically translate into housing demand.  Plus, as more boomers hit 65, there will be an exodus from the ranks of working-age people, even if for a year or two it seems that the working-age population is rising.  Much of the rise is because the exodus did not begin before the small number of new 22 year-olds entered.

Also note that even if the number of working-age people remains decent :

a) Student loan debt will delay house-purchases by years, for millions of them.
b) The marriage rate is falling, as young people don't find marriage as compelling.  This means that the *composition* of housing being demanded will be different, with more people in condos their whole lives and fewer buyers for 4-bedroom suburban homes. 
c) A lot of the young people entering working age are from lower-income ethnicities.  This ensures that they cannot prop up the housing market as they are not like-like replacements for aging boomers.

Not all housing is equal. 

A certain type of housing (the 4 bdrm single for example) is now persecuted by a majority of citizens that have embraced environmental totalitarianism. These forces work towards a supply restriction and thus eventual scarcity developing in those market segments. 

Look at Europe for what lies ahead for the US. Few people have 4 bdrm single family houses, and that is not because they don't want them or because they voluntarily moved away from desiring them. 
 
I was born and grew up in Europe. The housing prosperity we have here in the United States is by comparison astronomical. And it will not last since most Americans seem fatally attracted to the European societal model (the 1% growth continent in a 4% growth trendline, go figure, but that's what it is).

I'd also like to know why should I work if helicopter money is going to rain from the sky in the future. Even more important, why should my children have any ambitions and work hard? Why not take it easy? Seems like some significant benefits will unconditionally rain from the sky, redistributed benefits from the few that can now produce a lot due to technological leverage. 

And why would my country, with such a demotivated, central bank redistribution welfare pampered workforce, have enough productivity to remain in the developed world of 2080?

<i>A certain type of housing (the 4 bdrm single for example) is now persecuted by a majority of citizens that have embraced environmental totalitarianism. These forces work towards a supply restriction and thus eventual scarcity developing in those market segments.</i>

It also depresses demand.  Plus, there is no restriction in places with higher birthrates (such as Texas).  

<i>I was born and grew up in Europe. The housing prosperity we have here in the United States is by comparison astronomical.</i>

Europe's population density is much higher then the US.  Key metros like NYC and SFBA are as expensive as London, but the suburbs of Tier 3 cities in the US are the cheapest housing of any first-world country.

<i>I'd also like to know why should I work if helicopter money is going to rain from the sky in the future. Even more important, why should my children have any ambitions and work hard? </i>

The people with that mentality are not the ones who generate the most productivity.  The most productive people continue to work long after their net worth surpasses $5M, $10M, $20M, etc....

Plus, as the article states, when income taxes are zero, the incentive to work is much higher.  You are taking only one side of the ledger into account.  With no income tax, the incentive to work is much, much higher.  

Lastly, <u><a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/7-government-policies-must-adapt-and-quickly.html">Chapter 7 further addresses this point</a></u> :

"The first is the speculation that such a stipend will merely create a leisure class out of the bottom 60-80% of the population, who spend their lives immersed in various types of home entertainment.  They may do nothing else with their time and do not set good examples for their children, who then fail to grow into productive innovators that sustain the ATOM.  Putting aside the fact that such a concern is mutually exclusive with worries that AI will leave millions permanently unemployed, or that healthcare costs are surpassing affordability, it is unfounded in any event. "

Plus, read Chapter 9 about talent monetization by era.

Thank you Mr, Gada. 

I may be combative, but in a Socratic way. I'm indeed honestly interested (and I'm not saying that tongue in cheek) whether you may help me see another reality and get me unstuck from what seems to be a rather deep rooted narrative. A narrative developed from comparative observation in having lived in a statist continent and a less statist one. 

You are the only person I have found so far offering a different narrative worth considering, hence my keen interest. 

I have a deep interest in trying to predict the future with a probability that is even remotely better than random. The stakes, both personally and nationally, are enormous indeed. 

In that spirit,...

I'm not as productive as the people who earn tens of millions indeed. But I'm productive enough to be in the world's top 0.3%. I may be a tier 3 or 4 compared to the uber productive innovators. However the uber productive innovators still need me. Without me, or with a less motivated me, the über productive may lose enough competitiveness to be overtaken by marginally more productive uber complexes in distant lands -- and then the death spiral begins -- likely already has, as evidenced by our below par growth trendline. 

I also think that at the micro-economic level you assume too much about some rather binary nature of productive people. Does the US have the only naturally motivated people? 

More to the point, I may be productive enough to be in the world's top 0.3% (American mid upper class, the three percenters) however I've always found the hippie life of some of my immediate relatives attractive. I'm rather certain that had I not migrated to the US -- where the rich are less taxed and the less productive are less insulated from the consequences of mediocrity -- I would have settled into an easier less ambitious European life. A life of being only a quarter as productive as I am today, earning one quarter of what I earn today and being a quarter less helpful in helping realize the vision of the uber smart who indeed change the world through the leverage of technology. These less motivated people, these people living in the flatter effort-reward curves of Europe, are the T.S.'s who help the, say, French uber productive. That is why there's no French Steve Jobs, Larry Page etc. 

All summed up, I still prefer what I did by immigrating to the US -- but not by a wide margin! 

If you offer me the European quarter prosperity life, without any work at all, then I may just take it. If not me, many people at the margin will. Then, once a few uber innovative companies start falling to international competition, some uber productive people, at the margin, will say "heck not worth it wasting my youth over this, the reward is just not a high enough multiple to lose sleep, increase chances of pancreatic cancer etc. ". This is, after all, the predominantly failed fate of the uber productive amongst the French who tried. After a few intergenerational experiences at this failure you stop trying. Low ambition and survival in mediocrity become internalized into the dominant national culture.  And, as the uber productive fall, they drag down some of us 3 percenters (3 percenters in the US = 0.3 percenters worldwide) and we then drag down the middle class, their mechanics, their gardeners, their house cleaners. Essentially, the death spiral to a one percent European trendline growth country in a world that is riding a four percent trendline and, as you brilliantly point, ever accelerating!

But perhaps most important, 

Your point about the abolition of the tax disincentive more than compensating for the helicopter allowance disincentive is very well taken. However...

once I get that steady quarter income while the presumably more "genetically programmed/addicted to ambition" uber rich continue to earn tens of millions (according to your narrative they are apparently immune to international competition) why not get my pitchfork out, together with the other 99% and vote to double, then quadruple, then octuple etc. our unconditional helicopter allowance? The argument we are earning 40k, 80k, 160k, 320k while they earn 400 times that will always hold -- and as you point, will even accelerate. With such a strong majority, "of course we can, and will!" What would prevent that from happening? The fact that the ATOM may be slowed down just enough to be overtaken by the ATOM of other countries? Do you think we understand those things as voter-lemmings? 

If we did understand we would not be paining for candidates that will further flatten the effort-reward curve while our country's growth is already in a structurally anemic 2% growth trendline, half the world average. We don't even understand the deterministic arithmetic of exponents of decline!

For the time being I still see your theory the same way as I see Marx's theory: Very sophisticated and conceived by a very brilliant person indeed. But one fatal flow for Mr Marx: People have little desire to work for distant unknowns, and coercing them to do so does not work -- at least not to the extent of preventing other marginally more motivated people in other countries from overtaking them. I'm, of course, not implying that this is also the flaw of your theory. I have a hunch there is some fatal flaw in your theory and I'm trying to either find it or be convinced to your line of thinking. 

Now, having said that, I do believe a distortion crisis, one much bigger than the previous one, is in the cards. But I think that the distortion is the distortion of a developed world who is trying to desperately cling on to its supremacy by flattening the effort-reward curve. The slow growth and desperation of decline this causes will predictably and reflexively lead voters to get out their pitchforks and demand even further flattening of the effort-reward curves --and thus cement the stranglehold of a classic vicious cycle to decline. A vicious cycle few countries will escape, though some will emerge battered but freer to lead the next burst in a yet more inevitable successful branch of humanity. The ATOM will indeed advance and, though I agree with your prediction, I don't quite see eye to eye in some of your more pivotal explanations and remedies. 

 In my estimation it matters little what form this flattening of the effort-reward curves will take, it being helicopter allowance or what have you. This distortion is coming close to an uncontrollable breaking point. 

The enormous leverage of technology is creating and will continue to create enormous inequalities. Those electorates that can live with that will prosper, even if unequally so. Those who find these growing disparities unbearable will find themselves all more equally poor. Better of than today but poor by the fantastic living standards of the latter half of this century. 

The middle income country of the 2070s will have a much higher living standard than the US has today. But will you want to be in a middle income country in 2070? Would you be happy living in today's Angola under the consolation that the standard of living is better than 1880s London? We do judge prosperity in relative terms, after all. That is exactly why we are envious of our neighbors and the big house in the cup-de-sac in the first place. 

Hence the voter-lemming's conundrum: Accept the mansion in the corner without envy, or become the more equal citizen of a middle-income country by the latter half of this century.

Thanks,

<i>But I'm productive enough to be in the world's top 0.3%. I may be a tier 3 or 4 compared to the uber productive innovators. However the uber productive innovators still need me. </i>

Then you should still be very excited about the phase-out of income taxes.  Your (after-tax) pay from your job is set to rise a lot, on top of the DUES.  I don't think you will reach a point when you decide not to work if it involves turning down what will by then be a $300,000 job with no income tax, 10 years from now.  

<i>I also think that at the micro-economic level you assume too much about some rather binary nature of productive people. Does the US have the only naturally motivated people?</i>

I don't see the productive Europeans retiring early either.  They keep going.  

<i>That is why there's no French Steve Jobs, Larry Page etc.</i>

There does not need to be, as the ATOM knows no international boundaries.  Sergey Brin and Elon Musk were immigrants to the US, as you mentioned.  

<i>If you offer me the European quarter prosperity life, without any work at all, then I may just take it.</i>

I don't think you would, if you were younger than, say, 70.  Keeping up social status is one form of pressure.  The higher pay of existing jobs is another.  The chance of more careers closer to what you really want to do, is another.

<i>If not me, many people at the margin will. </i>

Some may, but those people were not essential to ATOM advancement to begin with.  

In the 19th century, there was no end to authors writing about how once basic needs are met, people will work fewer hours.  Their definition of 'basic needs' from their point of view was so low that in the US, that would take the average person just 10 hours of work per week.  Yet, that did not happen.  New products and services become desired.  Many things that you do for fun, and would not want to give up, are things your grandparents never even considered to be available to them.  Internet access, for one thing.  

Even today, you can move to India and live in an Ashram where room and board are free (paid by donors).  Your only job is to meditate, teach children to meditate, tend the garden, etc.  No stress and no money needed.  Perhaps boring, but also fulfilling.  

<i>according to your narrative they are apparently immune to international competition) </i>

This situation is possible in all countries of ATOM density.  Have you read Chapter 10?

<i> The fact that the ATOM may be slowed down just enough to be overtaken by the ATOM of other countries?</i>

The ATOM has no borders, only minor ebbs and flows based on the policies of one country vs. another.  All major technologies immediately become available to all who can afford them, irrespective of which (stable) country they live in.  When a VR Headset is released by Facebook or Samsung, is it not released in France and Germany almost on the same day?

<i>People have little desire to work for distant unknowns, and coercing them to do so does not work </i>

This is not coercion.  This is in fact an unprecendented high level of freedom and autonomy, with a major reduction in government meddling.  The ATOM dues monthly increment is calculated in a very formulaic and transparent way.  

<i> Would you be happy living in today's Angola under the consolation that the standard of living is better than 1880s London? </i>

That comparison is useful in some areas, but not others.  It is amazing to think that just 100 years ago, 1.3 million W. European soldiers killed each other in the Battle of the Somme.  Today, that is the sort of thing we expect nowhere except the Congo or Middle East.  
___________________________________________

Keep in mind another dimension, which is that once AI can advance without any human assistance, technologies that increase human living standards may plateau.  That is some decades away, but humans are not the final stage of the procession at all.

Well, sorry for posting comments that may be generally boring, but I'm not convinced. 

I don't agree that a helicopter allowance is not coercion. When some people work for their reward (however high) and some get rewarded in addition to the market value of their production then it is at least unwilling redistribution. 

Your conjecture is that the ATOM produces so much wealth that whatever amount of redistribution occurs through the helicopter allowance is relatively small, smaller than current taxes, and thus has little impact on incentives. 

But, as you said, standards of living, and thus expectations, will rise to unimaginable levels, and so will our political and electoral demands out of the helicopter allowance and the ATOMs energy. 

So I would probably turn down that 300k job, since it will be much easier to get together with my supermajority buddies and vote to increase our helicopter allowance to 300k. Working for Larry Page (the demands of the ATOM) is not that easy of a job, you know. So when I see the ATOM morph Larry Page into Larry Page squared, I'm going to want a bigger (much, much bigger) helicopter allowance. If I get 150k from the ATOM then perhaps I'll just retire to the lake, or just find a part time job where I produce one third of what Larry Page demands and earn 100k just to top off my helicopter allowance. I'm also confident that with a little bit of political campaigning and a solid 90% percent supermajority I can get the ATOM to shell out the full 300k. The less productive people at the firm who depend on my 300k job? Oh well, good luck to them, they'll figure it out.

Your theory seems to me more along the lines of the old hippie dream with different mechanics: "The machines will produce so much that we will no longer have to work (much). Some people will have more but a basic decent living will be available to everyone from the work of the machines (and the helicopter allowance in our case)". 

Oh well, I guess the hippies grew up and now they want more. The "basic decent living" of yesteryear is no longer "decent". It's poverty! They now want  a twenty first century lifestyle, of course. Just like I will want a Larry Page lifestyle and will vote to get enough helicopter allowance to approximate it. 

Sure, things could become so different that things as we know them (indeed they will become different sooner than most realize) such as voting, our descent into pitchfork democracy, etc. may resemble nothing we know. Well, while I agree that an unimaginable fantastic future awaits, beyond the myopic vision of most voters (talk about the delusion of climate activists who think the world in a hundred years will be more or less like today except warmer) I think we should wait a bit until that future starts to materialize, rather than start right away with the futuristic helicopter allowance. 

BTW, do you think the Swiss were wrong to recently defeat their helicopter allowance at the polls? Along the same lines, why not wait for another country to vote the helicopter allowance (Japan is almost doing it indirectly)? Then if it works we join the bandwagon when helicopter allowance 3.0 comes out. 

And also BTW, I totally agree with you that most people have their heads buried in the sand minutia of everyday life rather than anticipating the very rapidly changing future, as evidenced by the total lack of writings and discussion on the true future, the unimaginable to us fantastic future that will come much sooner than most anticipate. 

I'm saying that not being a young dreamer. I'm actually quite deep into middle age. 

P.S. I don't earn 300k (at least not yet, not without a more mature ATOM) but I am in America's top 3%, hence about top 0.3% worldwide.

This is better than what exists presently.  Remember that 75% of all government spending in the US is a direct transfer.  In Europe it is even worse.

No.  It can only rise at a certain ceiling rate.  The Fed governors are not elected, otherwise QE would already be something voters could force even today.  

<i>The less productive people at the firm who depend on my 300k job? Oh well, good luck to them, they'll figure it out.</i>

This contradicts your other claim that people will stop working if their basic necessities are met.  

As per your comments it appears that you :

a) think that there is not already a massive redistribution underway
b) have not taken into account how much inefficient wastage already occurs, both in taxation and disbursement
c) have surprisingly little awareness how much incentives change when the marginal tax rate goes from 50-55% down to zero.  
d) are not aware that $220B/month of QE is already being done worldwide as we speak (see Chapter 4).  
e) probably have not read this entire publication.

Read the whole thing.  

Too much of your comment(s) are just resistance to change, without seeing how much redistribution and wastage is already happening, and how inferior it is to the DUES program.  Plus, it does not appear you have taken into account how much QE is already being done now.

<i>Like buying a seat on an airline.</i>

Precisely.  Although this only applies to high-income people.  The higher one's income, the more methods one has to make their tax rate zero.  Mitt Romney got slammed for doing something completely legal in his IRA, but people much richer than Mitt Romney (like Donald Trump, Warren Buffet, and George Soros) do even more elaborate things.  It is legal, since the tax code is complex enough to provide far too many loopholes for anyone to monitor.    

That is why a 'tax increase' never works, and actually solidifies the ultra-wealthy by removing their upper-middle-class competition...

This is also why high-tax states lose middle-class jobs, but continue to be the leaders in the most profitable industries.  Apple, Google, and Goldman Sachs don't pay any significant tax, nor do most of their upper executives.  

A 15% flat tax would collect a lot more from the wealthy than the current tax code.  But 0% income tax is possible by 2025 under the ATOM-DUES plan, and should be the goal.

I have always been an advocate of a flat tax, or better yet, a VAT system. Complicated laws have a tendency to favor those with the time and money to game the system, which is not coincidentally why large corporations favor more regulation, not less.

Geoman,

Yes.  This is why I favor a plan of phasing out all income tax.  0% income tax is the fairest of all (see Chapter 10).  

0% tax also means zero filing and compliance burden.  The costs of this are astronomical, and no longer needed to fund a robust safety net (a substandard version of which is what most government spending goes towards anyway).

Hi KG, still doing my re-read, you will want to update from your 2017 prediction.  Also, from a rhetorical perspective, I would back off from discussing taxes as that pulls people into conventional thinking and arguments.  The expansion of the money supply via paying out to the people is your radical idea that you need to sell.  People have to buy that first before they will be open to it replacing income taxes.   Thanks, Drew

Drew,

This is true.  That is why the subsequent idea of the Sovereign Venture Fund, is the much easier sell.  

<a href="https://www.singularity2050.com/2018/04/a-country-specific-solution-for-technological-competitiveness.html">https://www.singularity2050.com/2018/04/a-country-specific-solution-for-technological-competitiveness.html</a>

Unfortunately, it does not help the bottom 60% of people nearly as much as ATOM-DUES would, and is more vulnerable to polticization.  

But if people make it too hard for the best solution, we have a second-best one instead.

T.S.,

You raise some interesting points.  With respect to pitchfork democracy demanding a larger amount of helicopter money, would it be any different than the current system now?  People can demand ever more government freebies but the gov knows that too high a tax rate will kill the golden goose.  Perhaps it'd be the same for the ATOM and helicopter money.  Of course the real public debate always comes back to what amount/rate can be withdrawn without killing the golden goose.

On the topic of motivation to work, first I'll start with some premises.  Almost every basic necessity and nice thing in life is partially inelastic in supply due to physical limitations of space and resources.  For example, a nice place in the city (limited land) or at least shelter somewhere (land, building supplies), or a nice car or pair of golf clubs (raw materials).  ATOM's progress will make some of these supplies more elastic over time, like for example asteroid mining for precious metals.

If everyone got helicopter money, that money would chase the essentials and the luxuries of life and thus drive up prices.  It'd likely be enough money for everyone to live comfortably and quietly somewhere, without worrying about shelter/food/health/etc.  But it won't be enough to compete for many luxuries of inelastic supply.  People who want luxuries will have to work and out-compete others to afford them; analogous to the current system that 10%ers experience today.

You raise a good question about why not just relax once the threat of wage slavery is removed.  The discussion has also touched on the baseline creep of what's considered minimum needs.  As technological progress continues the life one can buy with just helicopter money will become increasingly luxurious on an absolute scale, but at the same time even newer and exponentially nicer luxuries (of an inelastic supply) will become available and our human nature will make us want them.

How does the human psyche balance needs vs wants vs laziness vs jealousy?  On one end, if we're starving we'll work like mad to get food.  On the other, if I could live on a luxury villa without working but I'd need to work to also have a 100 meter yacht, I think I'd be ok not working.  But then there's that human desire for more and that human jealousy (of all those yacht-havers!).  That psychological balance is the key question.

Humanity probably makes up a Gaussian distribution for the absolute quality of helicopter-money-life required for an individual to stop working.  Whether this is sufficient for ATOM's needs depends on the Gaussian's width and its position on the x-axis of absolute quality of life.

<p>Tying all of these observations and analyses together, the comprehensive definition of what the Third Millennium Economy is and how it behaves can be summarized as follows, and in the attached <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a00d83452455969e201b8d1f6b63c970c img-responsive"><a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/files/atom-summary.pptx">Powerpoint</a></span></span>&nbsp;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technological change, despite occasional deviations from the trendline, is exponential and accelerating.&nbsp; There is centuries of data to ratify this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Economic growth is driven by technology, and has always been exponential and accelerating. Half of all world economic growth that has ever occurred has happened after 1998, and that is even if you use the limited metric of 'Real' GDP.&nbsp; If one uses the more accurate metric of equity indices, half of all world economic growth that has ever happened has been after 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Technological disruptions generally displace one set of industries and workers, while creating more wealth elsewhere. More wealth is created than destroyed, but often in different places.</li>
<li>Technology invariably finds a way to displace a commodity, organization, or industry that is resistant to technology or otherwise obstructs the progress of technology, whether directly or very indirectly.</li>
<li>No industry is immune to technological disruption, and industries that resist this process merely experience a sharper disruption at a later date.</li>
<li>Technological disruptions tend to be interconnected with each other, and a rapid disruption in one area exerts a strengthening force on other nascent disruptions.</li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) will eliminate many jobs, but will also create a vast category of new business models and careers. Media coverage of AI focuses only on the former effect, ignoring the latter.</li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence always creates more jobs than it eliminates, as long as the government does not make it too hard to be an entrepreneur.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Technology is inherently deflationary. While this effect was too minor to matter until recently, with technologically-deflating products now comprising 3% of annual world GDP and rising at an exponential rate, this deflation now has significant (and still rising) macroeconomic effects.&nbsp; AI in particular will be exceptionally deflationary.</li>
<li>An increasingly outdated focus on ‘Real’ GDP, instead of Nominal GDP, has led to a primary cause of economic sluggishness and weak job creation being overlooked. It is erroneous to assume that low inflation does not correspondingly decrease Real GDP growth.</li>
<li>The Federal Reserve should aim for an NGDP target, rather than an inflation target. Inflation will still be just 2-3% within a 6-7% NGDP environment.</li>
<li>The central banks of the world have been generating new money in a pattern that is rising exponentially, contrary to what they expected. This is due to the need to offset technological deflation.</li>
<li>Despite talk of QE and other expansion programs ending, they cannot end, nor can they even fail to increase the amount of QE each year.&nbsp; The coronavirus crisis jolted central banks into the correct (i.e. higher) trajectory of QE, even if establishment Economists do not understand why.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>World monetary creation by central banks has to rise 16-24% year over year to keep inflation in the 2-3%/yr range.</li>
<li>March 15, 2020, was effectively the 'Netscape Moment' in Economics, as the US Federal Reserve conceded defeat in their attempts to reverse all prior monetary creation, and instead caught up to where they should have been all along.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The next question becomes how the governments of the world should transition to this new reality.&nbsp; Policy inertia and status quo bias are the default situation for most countries.&nbsp; This has introduced a variety of imminent risks.</p>

This chapter seems a bit light.  I think you could have a lot more predictions and assessments of the impacts of the ATOM.

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-asodr1mw&amp;feature=youtu.be"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(Video)</span>.</a> &nbsp;There have been a number of previous instances where talk of a ‘new economy’ has emerged, only for the suggestion to be shot down wholesale when the subsequent market crash arrived.&nbsp; This condemns the valid observations to get buried in the frenzy of retroactive rejection, hedging, and caveats as perma-pessimists are given media exposure. &nbsp;More specifically, the missing ingredient in most prior debates and analyses of technological economics is a sufficient examination of the technology-driven convergence of previously unrelated forces, and whether we are far enough along the exponential megatrend described in Chapter 2.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/3-technological-disruption-is-pervasive-and-deepening.html">We have established earlier</a></span> that while people have grown accustomed to seeing all forms of consumer technology continuously decline in price, very few take the next step and observe the ever-widening array of products that continue to merge into this river of exponential technological deflation.&nbsp; Fewer still contemplate the effect this has on the broader macroeconomy, and why this was too insignificant to matter until recently, but no longer.&nbsp; It is surprising how little thought is given to this even by established economists and governments, despite how it affects nearly everything of economic and social consequence.&nbsp; Why might this be?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Intertwining of Disparate Phenomena :&nbsp; </strong>To approach the nexus that this publication seeks to address, we must first map the roads leading to it.&nbsp; There are three unrelated groups of experts who do not yet see that their fields are beginning to overlap significantly for the first time.</p>
<p>The first are the futurists and technology forecasters watching technological progress and predicting technological disruption (Ray Kurzweil being the most illustrious among them, even if his best output was in 1999-2008).&nbsp; They have done yeoman work in evangelizing why the rate of technological change is exponential and accelerating, and tracking examples that demonstrate this.</p>
<p>The second group is one of monetary policy experts observing every word uttered by the central banks of the world.&nbsp; They try to assess the impacts of various monetary expansion programs, and whether the style administered by one central bank is as effective as that done by another.</p>
<p>The third group consists of macroeconomists and fiscal policy 'experts' (i.e. they possess credentials) who keep track of government spending, taxation, debt levels, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve">Laffer Curve</a></span>, bond yields, and so on across each major nation-state.&nbsp; The budgetary process of their government is very important to their professional work and annual calendar.</p>
<p>But here we are in 2020.&nbsp; Even after four years of media appearance by me for the first version of this publication, each of these three groups are still baffled as to why their models and assumptions can no longer explain the peculiar disconnects that are appearing across financial markets, central bank liquidity actions, and economic indicators that steer government fiscal policy.&nbsp; The latter two groups are part of the establishment and prevailing zeitgeist, while the first group is small, seen as eccentric, mostly tied to the field of computer science, and has insufficient marketing expertise to generate mainstream awareness of their work.&nbsp; To my knowledge, no Western politician or central banker has ever uttered a single sentence about the accelerating rate of technological change and how governance has to mirror it in both agility and scope.</p>
<p>I have seen brilliant and acclaimed thinkers in each discipline figuring out a fraction of the composite body of knowledge presented here, but not an entire holistic view, much like the old story of a few blind men and an elephant. &nbsp;Part of this is due to not knowing where to continue the investigation.&nbsp; Why should a budgetary analyst read about accelerating technological change and Moore’s Law?&nbsp; Why should an AI expert dive deeply into central bank balance sheets?</p>
<p>When the spaces between previously unrelated fields begin to ignite the sparks of new knowledge, it is usually from an outside agent.&nbsp; I am not part of the formal establishment in any of these three groups, and perhaps that might just be what can enable a vision of what is to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Accelerating Technological Deflation, and the Federal Reserve :</strong> &nbsp;The primary discovery that every recommendation here rests on is that if rapidly-deflating technological products are now an impressive <a href="https://www.singularity2050.com/2019/08/timing-the-singularity-v-20.html">3% of GDP as of 2020</a>, there must be some resultant deflation affecting the broader economy.&nbsp; To detect this, we turn to the customary actions that governments take if they find inflation to be too low.&nbsp; If the government has been taking actions to fight deflation, and this deflation appears to be exponential, perhaps it has origins in the spread of technology through the economy.</p>
<p>In the United States, the Federal Reserve controls the Fed Funds Rate, which it raises when it expects inflation to be higher in the future, and lowers when the economy is weakening and/or inflation is trending too low.&nbsp; Until the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, this process was relatively straightforward, with the Fed Funds Rate very rarely ever going below 3% or so.&nbsp; Inflation was discussed as though it could fall in only two categories; ‘high’ and ‘very high’.&nbsp; It was further assumed that whenever employment reaches a threshold of ‘full employment’ that inflation was certain to accompany this.&nbsp; Many practices that require inflation to succeed, such as taking on mortgage debt, were assumed to be indisputable wisdom that had no such dependency.</p>
<p>However, after the technology boom and bust at the turn of the century, inflation was conspicuously missing.&nbsp; The Federal Reserve had the freedom to lower the Fed Funds rate all the way down to 1% in 2004, and while observers expected this would finally cause inflation, it still did not.&nbsp; Relatively few economists were particularly curious about why that might be, since the rate was still above zero, and the possibility of rates at zero did not seem realistic.&nbsp; Japan had lowered its own rate to zero, and still struggled with deflation.&nbsp; But since Japan has lower birth and immigration rates than the US, this explanation was deemed sufficient and Japan was not seen as an indicator of a broader phenomenon that could also emerge in the US.</p>
<p>As the economy strengthened, The Federal Reserve, expecting inflation, steadily increased the 1% Fed Funds rate all the way up to 5.5% by 2007, only to find that this was too high and that the housing market, and with it the entire economy, was weakening precipitously.&nbsp; The Fed reacted with a rapid reversal of rates all the way down to not just the 1% of 2003-04, but to nearly 0%.&nbsp; However, to the surprise of observers, even 0% was not enough to create inflation, so they began a form of monetary expansion known as ‘Quantitative Easing’ (QE).&nbsp; QE was designed to simulate the conditions of negative rates without deposits actually being docked an interest charge by banks.&nbsp; Some liken QE to ‘money-printing’, but that is not quite accurate, as the impact of each dollar can vary based on the method of QE.</p>
<p>Effectively, the Federal Reserve embarked on a campaign to expand the monetary supply via a process of asset purchases.&nbsp; They would buy bonds, and hold the bonds on the balance sheet, with the implied understanding that the bonds would be ‘sold’ into the open market at some future time.&nbsp; By purchasing bonds, the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates even for longer-term loans, which would make borrowing attractive for consumers and corporations.&nbsp; The Federal Reserve thought that the first program of QE would be the only one, but when equities could not sustain any gains after the conclusion of the easing program, economic indicators weakened.&nbsp; In response, the Fed had to embark on a second program, calling in QE2.&nbsp; When the conclusion of QE2 promptly led to yet another major equity correction, a third bout, QE3, was ramped up and later concluded.&nbsp; After that, they thought they could start unwinding the balance sheet, embarking on a reversal of QE.&nbsp; This caused predictable economic deterioration and the Federal Reserve quickly reversed course with a new wave of QE.&nbsp; As of early 2020, there is still an assumption that QE can end, be reversed, and that even the Fed Funds rate can be increased and kept above zero.&nbsp; Under the principles of Third Millennium Economics, we know that this can not be the case.&nbsp; The coronavirus pandemic ended up being the black swan event that exposed the reality that the Federal Reserve was unequipped to face.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traditionally, money-printing has caused inflation in times before technology was an offsetting force.&nbsp; The Weimar Republic of Germany (1919-33) is often cited as an example of such peril.&nbsp; When the first round of QE started, a crowd of hyperinflation fearmongers arose, committed to a narrative that we were doomed to repeat the Weimar experience if we embark on this slippery slope.&nbsp; This group found a natural synergy with the technophobe movement, which is built around an insistence that technology has not created any real economic changes in the last century.&nbsp; Strident opposition to QE became quite fashionable, with all QE being equated to the mismanagement of Venezuela under Hugo Chavez.&nbsp; Some expended considerable effort to assert their supposed expertise by insisting that inflation was much higher than the data indicated.</p>
<p>As QE commenced, however, the inflation was minimal and transitory at best.&nbsp; There has certainly not been any sustained ‘high’ inflation to this day despite the immense amount of QE.&nbsp; Whether one looks at the official Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://bpp.mit.edu/usa/">MIT Billion Prices Project</a></span>, inflation is far below the zone where it could be considered adequate, let alone high.&nbsp; The hyperinflation cult has seen membership shrink, but new questions have emerged amidst the ashes of their failed predictions.&nbsp; Where is all that QE vanishing to?&nbsp; At what rate?&nbsp; Is this pattern of disappearance permanent?&nbsp; Is the QE turning up somewhere else?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/researchcq/shadow_rate.aspx">Cynthia Wu and Fan Dora Xia have published research on what is termed as the Fed Funds Shadow Rate.</a></span>&nbsp; While this research is little-known outside the immediate field, the discovery has profound significance, perhaps even greater than Ms. Wu and Ms. Xia realize.&nbsp; The shadow rate, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/researchcq/shadow_rate.aspx">which was updated monthly while the FF rate was near zero</a></span>, roughly tracks the effect of US QE on generating negative FF rates.</p>
<p>When it was active, this shadow rate revealed at the time that increasing levels of QE still did not generate noteworthy inflation, and this may be synchronous with concurrent ATOM deflation.&nbsp; The rounds of QE temporarily pushed the Wu-Xia shadow rate not merely to zero, but negative.&nbsp; The movement from 0% to -1% and -2% was swift, and the trajectory seemed to indicate that the trend of increasingly negative rates was not linear, but exponential.&nbsp; When the US stopped QE, the Wu-Xia shadow rate quickly rose back to 0%, and this coincided with increased deflation and a massive crash in the price of almost every commodity.&nbsp; This crash was despite the fact that excluding the US, the other central banks of the world were creating a combined total of over $200B/month as of early 2016, which has continued on a rising gradient through 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hence, if the Wu-Xia shadow rate is one of the possible tools to indirectly estimate the current ATOM deflation rate, then perhaps the measure of sufficient vs. insufficient QE is the gap between the two.&nbsp; Accordingly, when the rate is above where the ATOM indicates technological deflation to have reached by that point, then liquidity is insufficient and deflation manifests.&nbsp; When the rate is the same or lower than the ATOM deflation rate, then there is sufficient liquidity and a proportional level of inflation.&nbsp; This means that if there is to ever be significant inflation, the Wu-Xia shadow rate has to be more deeply negative than the estimated ATOM deflation rate.&nbsp; This itself is impossible when the FF Rate is above zero, pinning the Wu-Xia shadow rate to the same.</p>
<p>Now, if technology is rising as a percentage of world GDP, this could mean that the progression of the ATOM deflation rate from -1% to -2% is an ongoing trend.&nbsp; The rate could similarly double again from -2% to -4%, and, amazingly, from -4% to -8% by the 2030s, merely by technology rising from the current 3% of GDP to 4% very soon, and then 8%, and beyond.&nbsp; This sounds extraordinary, but unless one thinks that technology will shrink as a share of GDP, it is the course we are presently on.&nbsp; The level of monetary expansion needed to truly generate inflation is thus far higher than most economists think.</p>
<p>This theory, while still somewhat speculative at the time of ATOM v1.0, has since seen a torrent of evidence pile up in its favor.&nbsp; The amount of cumulative ‘QE’ by all the central banks of the world is accelerating exponentially despite no apparent aggregate quota being agreed to by the banks, which is exactly the opposite of what the establishment of Economists has continued to predict.&nbsp; The more cumulative monetary creation is done without hyperinflation rearing its head, the more the Third Millennium Economics thesis is strengthened with this accumulating proof.&nbsp; Each central bank is reacting to the conditions in its own country, but as the ATOM is global, the deflationary effect concentrates into countries with high technology density.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: right;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20264e2e12a60200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20264e2e12a60200d img-responsive" alt="21023" title="21023" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20264e2e12a60200d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>Even if one particular bank, like the US Federal Reserve, declared that it did not intend to conduct more QE (only to reverse that position shortly thereafter), other central banks moved to fill the gap, inadvertently ensuring that the combined total continues to rise.&nbsp; While the US Federal Reserve was still the laggard in terms of moving towards permanent and exponentially-rising QE, the coronavirus crisis forced them to do what they should have been doing anyway.&nbsp; On the seminal date of March 15, 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the Fed Funds rate from 1.5% just days earlier to 0%, where it should have been all along, and then pledged to restart QE and to do it in more direct forms rather than just the purchases of Treasuries and Mortgage Backed Securities (MBSs), moving precisely in the direction recommended by this publication for years.&nbsp; Given the sheer magnitude of the position change the Federal Reserve was forced to undergo in a matter of days (whether they still understand the new economics of technology or not), it is safe to say that March 15, 2020 was when the ATOM genie fully escaped from its bottle, and the economics of technology began in earnest.&nbsp; I have hence named that date as the 'Netscape Moment' in Economics, after the original 'Netscape Moment' on August 9, 1995, where the IPO of Netscape was a catalyst for an acceleration of the Internet revolution.&nbsp; Similarly, March 15, 2020 is the day when Third Millennium Economics were fully ratified.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the most recent grand total of over $30 Trillion in monetary expansion as of 2020 ($14 Trillion more than when the first version of The ATOM was published), the crash in commodity prices even more emphatically buries since ATOM v1.0 the fears of inflation, ‘peak oil’, and ‘a return to the gold standard’ that incorrectly arose from outdated, pre-software assumptions about supply and demand.&nbsp; It is obvious that all this newly created money has merely offset deflation, even after the temporary coronavirus pandemic subsided.&nbsp; As structural deflation accelerates, the level of world QE has to keep rising and be more diffuse and broad than current programs.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20264e2e8c2d8200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20264e2e8c2d8200d img-responsive" alt="YardeniBalanceSheet" title="YardeniBalanceSheet" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20264e2e8c2d8200d-500wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a>While not every type of monetary creation has the same impact per dollar, the rising total is indicative of an all-important phenomenon which the Economics establishment has still been unwilling to comprehend, let alone accept.&nbsp; Note how the next chart bears an uncanny resemblance to the exponential curves found in the writings of Mr. Kurzweil and other futurists.&nbsp; If this exponentially rising monetary expansion is associated with the trend of technological deflation, then monetary expansion, far from ending, has to be made permanent across all major world economies, be declared as such, and rise at a rapid rate each year.&nbsp; From the second chart, we see that the total amount of cumulative balance sheet addition also rises at an annual percentage rate much higher than simple NGDP.&nbsp; It is apparent that the notion of ever selling purchased assets on central bank balance sheets back into the market (a reversal of monetary expansion) is entirely out of the question, making the balance sheet itself a moot concept.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if all this newly created money does not cause inflation, is it utterly vanishing?&nbsp; On the contrary, the nature of technology is such that the liquidity is being metabolized by the ATOM.&nbsp; This increases the size and scope of the ATOM, which in turn demands more liquidity, which then produces yet more technology.&nbsp; This self-reinforcing process generates new productivity and economic growth, and is in fact an indicator of the macro economic growth trend seeking to return to the long-term trendline.&nbsp; Hence, this pattern of exponentially rising monetary expansion is itself the fuel that will keep the economic growth trend going.&nbsp; Over time, as technology becomes a sufficiently large portion of the economy, these two exponents will begin to merge.&nbsp; For this reason, there is a crucial prediction for the 2020s that I will put forth.&nbsp; The Economics establishment still thinks that the $23T in world monetary creation done up until December 31, 2019 will be unwound, effectively meaning that the amount of net monetary creation they predict will be -$23T, reducing balance sheets to zero.&nbsp; By contrast, it is obvious to me that this is another accelerating, exponential trend, and that the amount done in the 2020s will be an additional $100T or so, above the first $23T.&nbsp; This is before even adding the dimension of the monetary creation moving more towards cash sent directly to people, rather than the esoteric buying of Treasuries and MBSs.&nbsp; The first few months of 2020 certainly favor my prediction being the one that turns out to be correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we will see in a later section, this perpetual process can be modified into an exceptionally good circumstance and inaugurate a new age of prosperity.&nbsp; Unfortunately, central banks of the world are very far from internalizing this ATOM-reinforcing paradigm on multiple levels.&nbsp; Current monetary easing programs lead to the money accumulating disproportionately in the largest banks and technology companies, leaving most other sectors and affiliated individuals missing out.&nbsp; This narrow concentration is part of the reason that the various world central bank actions are not as effective as they could be, and why their actions did not reach down to small businesses and individuals during the 2020 coronavirus crisis.&nbsp; Furthermore, none of them are ready for the unprecedented technological deflation that is soon to arrive from Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Economics of Artificial Intelligence :</strong>&nbsp; The first item in the earlier ‘Panoply of Creative Destruction’ list was AI, and it is important enough to warrant a full section devoted to it.&nbsp; While this publication will not enter the debate about what meets the increasingly stringent yet strangely fluid definition of AI, there are some crucial factors that most factions in the AI debate have failed to consider.&nbsp; This leaves them and those who follow their guidance unprepared for some of the largest ripple effects of AI.</p>
<p>AI is a field that gets insufficient credit for the advances that it has made.&nbsp; For one thing, each new threshold set for AI capabilities becomes a non-event once met (such as when an AI defeated the top-ranked chess player in 1997).&nbsp; Additionally, each major new AI advance gets reclassified into its own industry (autonomous vehicles, high-frequency trading, intelligent search engines, etc.), and is no longer counted as AI.&nbsp; These factors contribute to a broad underestimation of how pervasive early AI has already become, leading to a doubly-false narrative that AI is both job swallowing and has suddenly appeared out of nowhere.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e202c8d3b5af95200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e202c8d3b5af95200b img-responsive" alt="Picture3" title="Picture3" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e202c8d3b5af95200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a>There has been a recent torrent of articles ranking jobs in relation to their vulnerability to AI replacement (see chart from Business Insider built via The Economist).&nbsp; This is a very incomplete oversimplification of the topic.&nbsp; Even those who recognize that past technological disruptions have always created an increase in net output and employment somehow worry that this time, the speed of replacement and widening skill mismatch chasm portend to massive dislocation and permanent unemployment.&nbsp; This is not only an incorrect prediction that fails to recognize how much more output will be generated per unit of input, but it distracts the debate from the other side of the coin.&nbsp; The simple fact is that for each job that AI can perform at lower cost than a human employee, an entrepreneur can save that payroll expense relative to a previous cost structure, enabling either widening margins or more hires elsewhere.&nbsp; Hence, job displacement through AI can only increase new business formation by the same or greater proportion.&nbsp; That is, if overt human meddling (whether through government or otherwise) does not unwittingly prevent this process from occurring.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/future-of-artificial-intelligence/">An article in Wired by Kevin Kelly</a></span> from a few years ago discusses why AI was back in the spotlight at the time after over twenty years of hibernation.&nbsp; Common topics include what various subcategories of AI could be like, and how it may augment human abilities in some areas while be an invisible in others, becoming a utility of sorts within a new status quo.&nbsp; I generally agree with this conclusion, but as far as AI competing with human jobs, these articles overlook the largest factor of all – the AI’s borderless and untaxable nature.</p>
<p>Whether an AI performs only the most repetitive work, or has capabilities that surpass that of any human, it can operate from anywhere.&nbsp; The AI can be owned by a corporation located in the most tax-friendly place available, changing its country of domicile in an instant if necessary.&nbsp; The AI does not care about the weather, commute distances, parking spaces, and holidays.&nbsp; The AI is not governed by cost-of-living constraints beyond the minimal costs of running the hardware that hosts the AI.&nbsp; By contrast, human output is taxed at marginal rates that often exceed 50%, and the higher-paying human jobs are concentrated in very expensive areas.</p>
<p>Hence, the primary handicap to human competitiveness in the face of AI is not the raw output of the human, but the taxation of the human’s productivity, and the high operating costs that a human incurs.&nbsp; This additionally means that a high tax on higher-income workers are more likely to hasten their marginalization in the face of AI.&nbsp; The state, instead of increasing taxes on productivity, has to figure out a way to move revenue sourcing in the opposite direction.&nbsp; Tax immunity means that AI enables technology to start tightening the screws on government revenue as well, which we will elaborate on in the next chapter.&nbsp; This process will be irreversible long before governments even notice the cumulative revenue erosion.</p>
<p>But as enormous of a factor as unfavorable taxation and megacity living costs may be, they are not the only reasons human workers may be uncompetitive with AI.&nbsp; Human employees demand medical, dental, and vision coverage from their employers.&nbsp; Humans have to interrupt their work several times a day for various aspects of personal maintenance.&nbsp; The AI that can do the work of a thousand humans can reside on hardware that fits in a single room in a remote location and consumes just a few hundred dollars of electricity per month.&nbsp; By contrast, each of those thousand human workers requires a house, a cubicle or office, a car, roads for the car, a food production chain, schools for their children, etc.&nbsp; If that were not enough, human workplaces have recently come under siege by extortionists demanding various politicizations of hiring, even at the cost of company productivity.&nbsp; When taking all these disadvantages into account, it may appear that humans stand no chance whatsoever, and is the basis for many pessimistic statements about the impact of AI, including from Bill Gates and Elon Musk.&nbsp; If even these luminaries of technology are apprehensive about what AI may do to human well-being, is this the beginning of the end?</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201bb09105aa0970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e201bb09105aa0970d img-responsive" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Manufacturing Output" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201bb09105aa0970d-320wi" alt="Manufacturing Output" /></a>Instead, the most accurate measurement technique is to chart input costs relative to output generated, and observe that human jobs tend to sprout up around this output over time in the process of managing, transacting, and consuming it.&nbsp; Continuing the prior example about agricultural employment and output going in opposite directions, the next sector, manufacturing, has been the subject of countless agonizing over the last 45 years of American economic media coverage.&nbsp; Everyone knows that manufacturing jobs have vanished and some categories of the working class have seen hardship.&nbsp; Yet the overlooked fact remains that US manufacturing output <em>never stopped rising</em>, as per this chart from Prof. Perry (that parabolic exponential curve shape appears yet again).&nbsp; Advances in automation have greatly increased output per worker, and shortening time between doublings of output is yet another example of exponential and accelerating productivity.&nbsp; The running joke in these circles is that the continuation of these trends implies an imminent outcome where the US produces $10 Trillion of manufactured goods while employing just one person.&nbsp; Additionally, despite the perception that US manufacturing jobs have moved to China, the reality is that China has lost even more manufacturing jobs than the US, while simultaneously increasing their own output <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/544201/china-wants-to-replace-millions-of-workers-with-robots/">through robotic replacement of human workers</a></span>.&nbsp; Anecdotes about job loss from manufacturing can easily be used to whip up emotion, but comprehensive data proves that the average American lives in much higher prosperity than during the supposed manufacturing heyday of 1946-69.&nbsp; This is true even if measured in purchasing power of any standard manufactured goods, without even counting how many categories of manufactured products did not exist then.</p>
<p>As<a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a4fc7524200b-pi"><br /></a><a class="asset-img-link" style="display: inline;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a4d7cc93200d-pi"></a>&nbsp;the ATOM transformed the agricultural and manufacturing sectors, the service sector was the beneficiary.&nbsp; But the ATOM is now at the service sector’s doorstep, and services will undergo an acceleration of the churning process that removes tasks (and some jobs) in the lower rungs to create new tasks and jobs in the higher rungs.&nbsp; Multiple studies indicate that it is not a binary outcome of a job surviving or being eliminated, but rather the percentage of tasks per job that can be automated with existing technology.&nbsp; It is estimated that 45% of contemporary tasks can be automated with existing AI, without even waiting for future advancements in AI.&nbsp; This data indicates that there are already many examples of two jobs that can be compressed into one with perhaps a higher salary than either.&nbsp; It additionally indicates that unless you have adopted as much AI as is fully possible for your profession, you are or soon will be a laggard.&nbsp; Fears over ‘outsourcing’ have been a distraction, since by the time a job can easily be outsourced to a low-cost country, the job is already on the verge of displacement by AI.&nbsp; But most importantly, this chart indicates <em>which functions an entrepreneur can now have done at a fraction of the previous cost</em> through use of an AI instead of a human.&nbsp; Indeed, some entrepreneurs may see charts like this, select which functions are the most completely assimilated into AI, and build a business entirely from only the functions AI can perform.&nbsp; Once thousands or even millions of entrepreneurs migrate in this direction, there is far more output generated per human.&nbsp; Within this process, the focus should be on the much higher aggregate output that AI will soon generate.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, if AI can produce the same $10 Trillion of economic output that today takes 100 million workers, then those 100 million people can transition (with varying levels of ease) to produce an additional $10 Trillion of output elsewhere.&nbsp; Hence, a total of $20 Trillion is now generated across the same number of people.&nbsp; Note the difference between ‘output generated’ and ‘jobs created’, a distinction that often escapes many participants in this debate, yet will soon be too pronounced to overlook.&nbsp; It will not be uncommon to see new types of small businesses earning $10 Million/year in annual revenue with only three highly-paid human employees.&nbsp; Human + AI teaming will be seen as the obvious end result of AI, with those who predicted massive human unemployment on account of AI being unceremoniously dumped into the dustbin of history, where the languish next to the 'peak oil' and 'QE causes inflation' predictor Hall of Shame.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This effect is certain to broaden the breadth and depth of globalization.&nbsp; What many a globalization pundit gets wrong is the discussion of outsourcing, as if jobs are finite and employers are wrong to seek lower costs.&nbsp; In reality, by the time any job category can be outsourced en masse, it is already very near to replacement by automation.&nbsp; But from the perspective of the employer or entrepreneur, the situation is inverted.&nbsp; If a highly-paid professional in an advanced economy can be replaced by an AI, that same capability is now available in backwater countries that did not even have any such human professionals before.&nbsp; The expertise gap between two economies may narrow in some areas, and widen in others, as the ability to harness AI will be the greatest determinant of competitiveness.&nbsp; Fountains of productivity may erupt in the most unexpected places.&nbsp; As a widening array of tasks can be performed through AI, new business models from agile entrepreneurs will keep emerging.</p>
<p>Not everyone, of course, is built for entrepreneurship or is at a stage in life where it can be entertained on short notice.&nbsp; In addition, our educational system is not structured to teach a child to think like an entrepreneur – quite the opposite, in fact.&nbsp; Therefore, the practical obstacle in this theoretical ascension of AI is the widening skills mismatch across the human workforce, both vertical and horizontal.&nbsp; Humans are not reprogrammable the way computers are, where one program can be uninstalled to make way for another to be installed in mere minutes.&nbsp; As of early 2020, there are over 7 million open positions in the US according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), even as several million people remain unemployed, some of them for years.&nbsp;&nbsp; A mid-career accountant or dermatologist cannot simply become a software engineer, let alone an experienced one, after just three months of training.&nbsp; Even when rapid retraining is possible, employers have to adapt correspondingly and accept the retraining as valid, or this will discourage other prospective employees.&nbsp; The subjective cost of stress derived from career uncertainty should not be dismissed.&nbsp; These, along with the aforementioned squeeze that AI will inflict on the tax base of all high-tax locations, are challenges for which I present a solution later in this paper.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is a recurring fear that AI will subjugate or even exterminate humans over resource competition, as depicted in many science fiction works.&nbsp; I believe that this is not a risk, since AI does not consume the same fuels that humans do other than electricity, which itself is becoming cheaper <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/3-technological-disruption-is-pervasive-and-deepening.html">as described earlier</a></span>.&nbsp; However, there is reason to believe that AI might elect to force humans into more productive/tech-advancing behavior, as determined by the goals of the AI.&nbsp; How this unfolds remains to be seen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Tyranny of Insufficient Nominal GDP :&nbsp; </strong>A curious thing happened several decades ago, when metrics to measure the output of a nation were being devised.&nbsp; The concepts of Gross National Product (GNP), and later Gross Domestic Product (GDP), measured economic growth by consumption and investment, without particularly high emphasis on productivity.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this meant that high inflation could make many economic statistics appear better than true economic conditions warranted.&nbsp; While some bouts of high inflation were due to one-time demographic factors (such as in the US during the 1970s), others were due to outright mismanagement.&nbsp; Some infamous examples were deliberate actions by corrupt governments.</p>
<p>In reaction to the effect that inflation occasionally had on boosting GDP without true increases in living standards, a mechanism to deduct inflation from raw (Nominal) GDP was devised.&nbsp; This inflation-adjusted GDP was given the credibility-enhancing prefix of ‘Real’.&nbsp; Real GDP worked well for a while, as it stripped out inflation, and thus was more closely tied to true gains in productivity and hence living standards.&nbsp; However, economists got carried away with Real GDP, which is only useful if measured over lengthy periods of time.&nbsp; Measuring Real GDP on a quarterly basis has no value outside of academia, yet it is headline news in the financial media each of the three or more times it is released and revised for a given quarter.</p>
<p>At the same time, Nominal GDP is not even reported by the financial media.&nbsp; If someone wants to see an official report on the latest Nominal US GDP, they have to go to a government website and download an Excel file.&nbsp; Hence, the release for NGDP does not show up in Google searches, so the notion of using the data is that much further from occurring to anyone.&nbsp; By training generations of economists, journalists, and financiers to look only at Real GDP, <em>there is a huge cognitive dissonance about the fact that most other economic indicators are tied to Nominal GDP, as is the performance of every investment vehicle</em>.&nbsp; Real estate, mutual funds, art, wine, and corporate valuations certainly rise in tandem with NGDP, not ‘Real’ GDP, and given how most real estate is highly leveraged, this is critically important.&nbsp; Major economic indicators like auto sales, home sales, job growth, and retail sales are similarly tied to more to NGDP than Real GDP.&nbsp; This chart of NGDP represents the trend all the way until the last quarter before the coronavirus pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a4aea79b200c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20240a4aea79b200c img-responsive" alt="NGDP+" title="NGDP+" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a4aea79b200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a>Inflation is similarly viewed through an outdated lens.&nbsp; Trauma from decades-old predicaments gave rise to economic assumptions that are starting to become obsolete.&nbsp; The high inflation of the 1970s created a herd of ‘inflation hawks’ who continued to overrate the imagined horrors of less-than-terrifying inflation rates of 4%.&nbsp; Intellectually lazy metrics like the ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misery_index_(economics)">misery index</a></span>’ emerged (a straight sum of the inflation rate and unemployment rate).&nbsp; Such a metric not only presumes that a 1% rise in the inflation rate causes as much hardship as a 1% rise in the unemployment rate, but implies that non-technological deflation is a good thing.&nbsp; A society with a 5% unemployment rate and 3% inflation rate is seen as no worse than a society with a 9% unemployment rate at -1% inflation rate, when in fact the latter climate is vastly worse for almost every socioeconomic class.&nbsp; A society that has steered a majority of households into acquiring debt to purchase real estate on leverage should be vastly more worried about deflation than inflation, even if 4% inflation were to appear.&nbsp; Sadly, this sort of metric produced by 'egghead' PhD Economists works its way through policy-level thought, with no accounting of the nuances of hardship that average people live under.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This brings us to an extension of the prior discussion about how deflation can be problematic.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.businesscycle.com/ecri-news-events/news-details/economic-cycle-research-ecri-the-song-remains-the-same-1">Some observers have noted that recent economic recoveries in the US have gotten progressively weaker</a></span>, and that this has constrained job growth (‘jobless recoveries’).&nbsp; But these observers still focus on how US Real GDP has fallen from 3% to 2% annual growth rates, overlooking the far more worrisome shadow trend of NGDP falling from 7% to 4% annual growth rates.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.aei.org/publication/the-link-between-slowing-nominal-gdp-growth-and-financial-crises/">There is evidence that insufficient NGDP growth momentum contributes to financial crises</a></span>, which are the more common type of recession in the current era, rather than manufacturing-based production recessions.&nbsp; It was assumed that low inflation did not constrain Real GDP, but apparently both inflation and Real GDP are trending lower in tandem, suggesting that the two have become correlated to each other.</p>
<p>Think of sufficient NGDP growth rates as being the speed at which a bicycle can move forward smoothly, and how insufficient speed makes the bicycle wobbly.&nbsp; An important component of NGDP is the concept of the Velocity of Money (VM), or how often the same dollar is transacted per unit time.&nbsp; Sluggish NGDP growth has greatly slowed VM, which in turn is a further retardant to future NGDP.&nbsp; This vicious cycle is difficult to break, for when the economic commentariat fixates exclusively on Real GDP, there is an underestimation of how much VM has in fact slowed with the NGDP erosion.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a4fc7bca200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20240a4fc7bca200b img-responsive" alt="Job Growth" title="Job Growth" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a4fc7bca200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a>Corporations make decisions on capital expenditure and hiring based on the expected growth trajectories of revenue and profits, which are a function of NGDP, not ‘Real’ GDP.&nbsp; No corporation reports its quarterly results in both nominal and inflation-adjusted terms, so academics are baffled as to why businesses are not hiring or spending just because Real GDP has decelerated slightly from 3% to 2%.&nbsp; As we can see from this BLS chart, percentage job growth is indeed trending lower in tandem with NGDP growth.&nbsp; Paradoxically, Nominal GDP is more ‘real’ (and certainly more relevant in real-time) than what is termed as Real GDP.</p>
<p>Additionally, insufficient NGDP has greatly constricted the technology industry, and hence technological progress.&nbsp; For one thing, the valuation multiples are not as high as they could be under a higher NGDP economy, as earnings growth rates would be higher.&nbsp; While safer value stocks perhaps saw their forward P/E ratios compress from 12 to 10, high-growth companies saw their forward P/E ratios compress from 60 to 30.&nbsp; This leads to the practice of some corporations (such as Comcast) prioritizing a dividend payout ahead of innovation, since dividends are valuable in a low-inflation climate.</p>
<p>You may think technology startup valuations are high now (most people only notice them at the topmost years of the cycle, not during the other three-fourths of the business cycle).&nbsp; But even these levels are less than what it naturally would be under the more optimal NGDP growth rate.&nbsp; These lower valuation multiples lengthen the duration from inception to liquidity for many tech startups, keeping investor money illiquid for longer.&nbsp; This makes it hard for the entire start-to-exit process to complete within a single economic growth cycle of 6-9 years.&nbsp; Such malaise has worsened the risk/reward profile of prospective venture capital rounds, and has moved the entire curve downwards, ensuring that medium-risk is the new high-risk, and low-risk is the new medium risk.&nbsp; Technology ventures with negligible sunk costs and no inventory builds get favored, while the more profound projects with large upfront costs become too risky and take too long to break even.&nbsp; For those dismayed by a technological future of social media addiction and underwhelming apps rather than space exploration, this is precisely the reason for that.&nbsp; Aside from Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Google, very few entities are willing to risk the upfront costs of ambitious ventures such as private spaceflight and electric cars.</p>
<p>Funding of lower capex ‘fluff’ at the expense of more serious technology reduces long-term, inflation-offsetting productivity gains.&nbsp; Over time, technological progress slows and gets further and further behind its long-term trendline.&nbsp; At present, my proprietary calculations estimate that after the 2001 technology bust, technological progress has been at only 60-70% of its natural rate, due to insufficient NGDP.&nbsp; This happens to be why many technological predictions made in 1999-2000 for circa 2020, including by Ray Kurzweil, are consistently 6-9 years behind schedule across many seemingly unrelated subsectors of technology.&nbsp; The impedance is holistic and pervasive.&nbsp; There is thus a tremendous opportunity cost involved in this excessive fear of even 3% inflation which has not been seen in two decades, a fear originated from conditions that can no longer arise in a world were technologically-deflating products are prevalent.</p>
<p>Some members of the Federal Reserve have indicated that monetary policy should target NGDP instead of inflation, and that the NGDP target should be 5%.&nbsp; This policy, if formalized, is a huge step in the right direction, but the target NGDP should be 6-7%, for economists will be surprised to see that even such NGDP leads to just 2%/year inflation.&nbsp; Thus, their precious 'Real' GDP will in fact register a superb 4-5% growth rate, or twice what we have seen for most of the 21st century to date.&nbsp; Higher NGDP means more technology which keeps inflation low, even at that higher NGDP, which produces more technology.&nbsp; This virtuous cycle can begin if the current vicious cycle is decisively attacked and broken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Equity Valuations as Harbingers of Future ATOM Growth :&nbsp; </strong>There is a robust and highly visible indicator that is corroborative of the centuries-proven accelerating rate of economic growth, and how that concentrates within technology.&nbsp; That indicator is the percentage of equity market capitalization comprised of companies selling products experiencing rapid technological deflation.&nbsp; How much can it reveal to us about future technological diffusion and resultant growth acceleration?</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 is a broad equity index in the US weighted by market capitalization (unlike the Dow Industrials Average, which knowledgeable investors give far less importance to than the S&amp;P 500).&nbsp; The S&amp;P 500 contains about 93-95% of the market cap of the entire US equity market.&nbsp; With almost half of the profits of S&amp;P 500 companies derived from overseas, it is a very comprehensive index.&nbsp; There was a time when companies categorized as part of the technology sector were not selling products that deflated in price so quickly (‘high-tech’ was just electrical equipment and motor vehicles).&nbsp; But once semiconductors and software started to advance in sophistication and scope, business models built around such rapidly deflating products proliferated and some became incredibly profitable.&nbsp; At first, only one or two such companies became large enough to be included in the S&amp;P 500 index.&nbsp; More followed them as computing began to percolate throughout the economy.&nbsp; Even after the technology bust of 2001-03, technology companies returned to being among the most valuable and highest-earning in the entire market.</p>
<p>As of 2020, the technology sector constitutes about 25% of the market cap, and contributes 22% of the earnings of the S&amp;P 500.&nbsp; The most purely deflating and materially efficient product category of all, software, emerged as the dominant product category sold by the most profitable companies.&nbsp; The other essentials of computing such as semiconductors and storage also feature prominently.&nbsp; Biotechnology is another subsector built around price-deflating products slowly penetrating the healthcare and pharmaceutical fortress.&nbsp; One might think that rapidly deflating product prices would have an adverse impact on revenue, life-cycle management, and inventory, yet the companies producing and selling these products generate 20% of the profits of the entire S&amp;P 500.&nbsp; Within these new business models resides a window into the future of the entire economy, for these economic fundamentals, forged in the crucible of tech companies, are propagating outwards.</p>
<p>Companies established enough to be part of the S&amp;P 500 have a market valuation derived from an expectation of future earnings, with a Net Present Value (NPV) calculation applied to appropriately weight the near future higher than the more distant future.&nbsp; As the P/E ratio of the technology sector is no higher than the broader index despite the higher earnings growth rates of the sector, eventually the price-to-sales ratio of the technology sector may converge to that of the rest of the S&amp;P 500 as well.&nbsp; This could occur from either direction, whether through technology revenue rising greatly, or the price of other sectors rising to synchronize their price-to-sales ratio to that of the technology sector.&nbsp; Remember that some current technology companies may no longer categorized as such in the future, even if their products are of a rapidly deflating nature.&nbsp; The NPV method and standard discount rates estimate this time horizon to be about 10-15 years, for any years further away than that would have too small of a weight under the NPV calculation.&nbsp; We hence have an approximate timeline for this rise in structural valuation, even amidst the booms and busts that will certainly occur along the way.</p>
<p>While this methodology is highly speculative, this coincidentally is along the same timeline where the technological percentage of world GDP is anticipated to reach 10% or higher, and provides independent support to that prediction.&nbsp; This is quite consistent with the exponential, not linear, deflationary trend we are seeing in exponentially rising world QE totals.&nbsp; The trend we have seen in both the computing and economic growth sections of this publication is further supported, and we are indeed very near to the ‘knee’ of the curve.</p>
<p>Do you remember the <a href="http://atom.singularity2050.com/2-the-exponential-trendline-of-economic-growth.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">earlier mention</span></a>&nbsp;of nation-state risk to exponential, accelerating economic growth?&nbsp; It is time to elaborate on what that means, and what forward-thinking governments can and must do to manage risk.</p>

I disagree.

It's true that AI would consume different fuels than humans.  However, a lot of the resources used to create human fuels can be redirected towards creating machine fuels.  Instead of having a biological solar farm that creates calories in the form of, say, corn, machines would be incentivized to create solar farms that create electricity in their place.

AI risk is a very up-in-the-air field currently.  The emergent characteristics that result from different starting conditions in the programming are very complex, and most of the arguments that claim to demonstrate that super-human AI is safe, or easy to make safe, do nothing of the kind.

If interested, this article does a good job summarizing what I think is the problem with this reasoning:  <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/29/no-time-like-the-present-for-ai-safety-work/">http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/29/no-time-like-the-present-for-ai-safety-work/</a>

Forge the Sky,

<i>Instead of having a biological solar farm that creates calories in the form of, say, corn, machines would be incentivized to create solar farms that create electricity in their place.</i>

Maybe.  I do think there is a chance that when AI can advance entirely without human assistance, then technologies that increase human living standards may plateau.  Humans are not the 'end goal' of evolution at all, and AI is far more suitable for space exploration or 'biocosm/intelligent universe' outcomes than anything that needs air and water.  

But I don't think resource battles are anything to worry about in the near term, since the high computational density of AI means that it will consume a significant amount of electricity until total aggregate AI intelligence is thousands or millions of times greater than that of 7-8 billion humans.   

By the time AI is consuming even 1% of world electricity (let alone 20% or more), it might have already helped elevate world GDP per human capita to $100,000/yr or more.  If there is to be conflict of a 'crowding out' nature at all, the 2040s would be the soonest when it could happen, and from a position of AI having thousands or even millions of times the power of all ~8 billion human brains.

"We have established earlier that while people have grown accustomed to seeing all forms of consumer technology continuously decline in price, very few take the next step and observe the ever-widening array of products that continue to merge into this river of technological deflation."  Indeed

There is merge, then there is MERGE.  Take for example, the smart phone. It actually replaces an alarm clock, a laptop, a radio, and several other devices.  They have been merged into a single device. The river is becoming a trickle, with just a few devices proving all we need.

Yes, totally.  You saw the <a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201b8d1f3cbe1970c-pi">iPod chart in Chapter 3.  </a>

But also keep in mind the other axis, which is that in the 1990s, the entire family had one landline phone (which had no other capabilities).  Now a household of four may have 4 smartphones if the children are old enough.  Tablets may be incremental.  

So there is merger per device PLUS more devices per person.  

The smartphone, at ~$600 without contracts or promos, is still expensive relative to, say, a laptop PC or even a 32-inch LED TV, so major price declines are still ahead of us as components fall in price and the majority of sales WW become upgrades..

One other bit of evidence you are right that you might not have considered:  Stock prices.

Stocks have crashed recently on several occasions.  each time the recovery has been ever faster.  but why?  Why do stocks rebound so quickly these days?  Even from historic crashes?

There is nothing else worth investing in.  Property is nice, but not mobile and convertible like a stock certificate.  If interest rates are low, then bonds are not performing.  Investment in stocks is investing, essentially, in the ATOM, because the companies productivity (and profits) grow with the ATOM.  Bonds are not part of the ATOM, and in fact are being eroded and destroyed by the ATOM.


By the by, look at the burgeoning tiny house movement - people are seeking less, not because they can't afford more, but they are realizing they don't need more.

Geoman,

Yes.  See the last section about how the tech sector is now 20% of the profits of the entire S&P500.  That corroborates exponential, rather than linear, growth.

> the higher-paying human jobs are concentrated in very expensive areas

I would say it is the other way around. The concentration of high income leads to lifestyle inflation and city gentrification.

Fatcat,

Cause and effect are mutually reinforcing, but it has proven notoriously hard for lower-cost locations to pull jobs away from NYC and SFBA, despite many attempts to do so.

"The smartphone, at ~$600 without contracts or promos, is still expensive relative to, say, a laptop PC or even a 32-inch LED TV."  You said that in 2016.

An unlocked IPhone8 cost $348 in 2020.  That's a generation better than the IPhone7 available in 2016.  That is about half...in just 4 years.  

Of course a 32 inch TV now now costs around $100, and you can get a very decent laptop for $300.  Both of which are measurably better in quality.

Geoman,

Yes.  Thanks for reading through the whole thing again.  Any useful links you come across, pls send over and I may incorporate them.

Note the point about the S&P 500.  If ATOM-heavy companies are 25% of its value, one has to treat that as a leading indicator of that percentage of the entire economy converging into high-tech in the forseeable future.

"The Federal Reserve had the freedom to lower the Fed Funds rate all the way down to 1% in 2004, and while observers expected this would finally cause inflation, it still did not."
- It inflated the housing bubble. Not to speak of oil prices.

You seem to have no respect for gold bugs (part of that is understandable, as there is still no hyperinflation from '09) but what are your explanations of what went wrong in '71? If not for Nixon and gold.

Hello Eugen,

You may wish to read this entire publication.

I don't think gold bugs have any understanding of the current economic climate, because the fundamentals of 1971 are vastly different than today.  Money printing no longer causes inflation, and gold has lagged the equity markets hugely in the age of QE.  Technology can increase the supply of gold, so all the traditional 1971-era assumptions that gold bugs use are very obsolete.

Kartik, 
Do you feel that lower inflation is the only reason for our lackluster technological progress? After all, universities and governments also are a significant source of research and it seems like they shouldn't be affected by inflation.

Hello Michael,

Insufficient NGDP (of which inflation is a component) is not the only reason for low technological progress.  It is among the top three reasons, though.  Unfavorable tax and regulatory frameworks are an even larger reason.  

Chapters 6-10 can elaborate more.

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>There is a single light of science, and to brighten it anywhere is to brighten it everywhere.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">– Isaac Asimov</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">– Arthur C. Clarke</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIYdZ9qDtDU">(Video)</a></span>.&nbsp; Third Millennium Economics has Already Enveloped Your Life :&nbsp; </strong>If we are to begin to believe that a centuries-old trend of accelerating economic growth is ongoing and about to take us to very high growth rates, we have to take the analysis to a much more personal and precise level.&nbsp; We have to observe and measure how this trend has enveloped your life.</p>
<p>The ubiquitous meme embedded into most discussions of technological progress is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_Law">Moore’s Law</a></span>.&nbsp; The iconic observation by the great Gordon Moore of Intel traces its origins back to 1965, where an article in Electronics Magazine described how the number of transistors in an integrated circuit is destined to double every year (later revised in 1975 to double every two years).&nbsp; Now, half a century later, this publication aims to introduce a next-generation, two-axis concept to the venerable and still-valid but nearly-succeeded Moore’s Law.</p>
<p>Anyone who has purchased computers over the years has come to expect the price of computing power to halve every 18-24 months, making the expanding constellation of gadgets cheaper and smaller. &nbsp;But for most people, the observation stops there.&nbsp; They don’t see the true long-term implications of this pricing phenomenon beyond the need to upgrade their computer or smartphone every few years.&nbsp; This oversight is akin to missing the forest from fixating on an individual tree.</p>
<p>Since Moore’s Law is limited to semiconductors, and specifically to comparing one chip to the next one chip, the unknown sister of Moore’s Law must be mentioned alongside it. &nbsp;Data storage technologies have improved in a manner identical to Moore’s Law, even though it involves different technologies only indirectly related to semiconductors, in entirely different companies.&nbsp; One dollar purchases more storage than one billion dollars could have purchased forty years ago, and that storage occupies much less space today.</p>
<p>But there is yet another layer to this exponential progress, which transcends even Moore’s Law and the equivalent for storage.&nbsp; Consider that on top of the approximate 18-month doubling times of both computational power and storage capacity, both of these industries have grown by a combined average of approximately 14% a year for the last fifty years. &nbsp;Individual years have registered much higher or lower growth than that, but let us say that the trend growth of both industries continues to be 14% a year.&nbsp; Software price-performance doubles at a much slower rate (6-9 years per doubling, by many estimates), but nonetheless is an exponential improvement in its own right.</p>
<p>This revenue growth rate is a general indicator of device proliferation and technology diffusion, and many visible examples of this surging wave present themselves to the observant eye. &nbsp;Consider the television programs of the 1970s, where the characters had all the household furnishings and electrical appliances that are common today, except for any product with computational capacity. &nbsp;Yet, prosperity has risen greatly since that time, and it is obvious what the only catalyst could have been.</p>
<p>Closer to the present, among 1990s sitcoms, how many plot devices would no longer exist in the age of mobile phones and Google Maps?&nbsp; Take a program as widely viewed as <em>Seinfeld.&nbsp; </em>Refer to the episode entirely devoted to the characters not being able to find their car, or each other, in a parking structure (1991),&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFKb3wA-qJQ">or this legendary bit from a 1991 episode in a Chinese restaurant</a></span>.&nbsp; These situations are simply obsolete in the era of mobile phones.&nbsp; The ‘Breakfast at Tiffany’s’ situation (1994) created by George Costanza would be obsolete in an era of Netflix, Wikipedia, and YouTube.&nbsp; The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2lfZg-apSA">‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Soup Nazi</span>’</a> of 1995 could avoid aggravation today by exclusively taking and fulfilling online orders for pickup.&nbsp; He would never have to see a customer face to face, just as well since he now has to contend with Yelp reviews.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, there was virtually no household product with a significant computing component.&nbsp; In the 1980s, many people bought basic game consoles like the Atari 2600 and had digital calculators.&nbsp; They purchased their first VCR, but only a fraction of the VCR’s components were exponentially deflating semiconductors, so VCR prices did not drop that much per year.&nbsp; In the early 1990s, many people began to have home PCs. For the first time, a major, essential home device was pegged to the curve of 18-month halvings in cost per unit of power.&nbsp; In the late 1990s, the PC was joined by the Internet connection and the DVD player.&nbsp; In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, dozens of new devices have been added, many of which constituted the high-tech augmentation of traditionally low-tech appliances.</p>
<p>We can now proceed to the real-world test.&nbsp; Everyone reading this can tally up all the items in their home that qualify as ‘technological deflation’ devices, which is any hardware device where a much more powerful/capacious version will be available for the same price in 2 years.&nbsp; You will be surprised at how many devices you now own that did not exist in the eighties or even the nineties, but you just cannot imagine living without today (this poll started with the first version of this publication in 2016).</p>
<p><strong>Include :</strong>&nbsp;Actively used PCs, LED TVs and monitors, smartphones, tablets, game consoles, VR headsets, digital picture frames, LED light bulbs, home networking devices, laser printers, webcams, DVRs, Kindles, robotic toys, and every external storage device.&nbsp; Count&nbsp;each car as 1 node, even though modern cars may have $4000 of electronics in them.</p>
<p><strong>Exclude :</strong>&nbsp;Old tube TVs, film cameras, individual software programs and video games, films on storage discs, any miscellaneous item valued at less than $5, or your washer/dryer/oven/clock radio&nbsp;just for having a digital display, as the product is not improving dramatically each year.<a name="pd_a_9329095"></a></p>

<p>By my estimation, the approximate number of devices in an average US home that are on this curve, by decade :</p>
<p>1970s and earlier : 0</p>
<p>1980s : 1-2</p>
<p>1990s : 2-4</p>
<p>2000s : 5-10</p>
<p>2010s : 12-30</p>
<p>2020s : 50-100</p>
<p>2030s : Hundreds?</p>
<p>This progression is even more striking when you consider how many devices are simultaneously consolidating.&nbsp; A smartphone now has a camera, storage, music player, calculator, alarm clock, and GPS system within it, removing all of those as separate devices.&nbsp; Despite the understatement inherent to counting nodes, more and more nodes, themselves rising in average complexity, continue to enter daily life.&nbsp; There was no metric of technological advancement before the modern era that was progressing so rapidly and widely.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a511e135200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20240a511e135200b img-responsive" alt="IPod Sales 2" title="IPod Sales 2" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a511e135200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a>This effect is visible across every type of electronic device.&nbsp; Take a look at this chart of Apple iPod unit sales in relation to iPhones and iPads (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/253725/iphone-ipad-and-ipod-sales-comparison/">chart from Statista</a>).&nbsp; There is great beauty in a chart like this.&nbsp; It initially encapsulated how when a combination of technologies (storage, batteries, music software, processing, etc.) finally becomes inexpensive and compact enough to be combined into a device of the right price, size, and utility, the sales of the novelty skyrocket.&nbsp; Yet when the functionality becomes mature just a few years later, the entire iPod becomes a subset of the more advanced iPhone or iPad.&nbsp; Individual iPods no longer sell at that point, much like individual calculators no longer sell.&nbsp; The entire lifecycle takes little over a decade, despite the multiple generations of improvement within this period.</p>
<p>Extrapolating a bit, we can project that the average home of 2025 will have various wonders.&nbsp; Multiple ultrathin TVs hung like paintings, robots for menial cleaning, VR-ready goggles and gloves, sensors and microchips embedded into clothing, table-sized surface computers, intelligent LED lightbulbs with motion-detecting sensors, and server-class home computers, to name a few.&nbsp; The home network of at least 15 nodes manages the entertainment, security, and energy systems of the home simultaneously.</p>
<p>At the industrial level, the changes are even greater.&nbsp; Just as with telephony, photography, video, and audio before them, we will see medicine, energy, manufacturing, media, and legal industries&nbsp;become information technology industries, and thus set to advance at rates much faster than before.&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic impact of this is staggering.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deflation has traditionally been a bad thing, but the ATOM has introduced a second form of deflation – a benevolent one.</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is to chart how many units of a certain technology can be purchased relative to GDP per capita.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/the-magic-of-the-global-marketplace-and-the-miracle-of-global-manufacturing-christmas-1964-vs-today/">In an article from Prof. Mark J. Perry</a></span>, we have a comparison of what was available to consumers in 1964 vs. 2016 (let alone 2020).&nbsp; This is an incredible illustration of how much quality has improved relative to purchasing power over a 50-year span, even though merely inflation-adjusted dollars are used, rather than Nominal GDP per capita.&nbsp; If NGDP per capita were used, then the impact is further quadrupled.</p>
<p>Now, when one expands the scope of this observation about proliferating deflationary nodes, we can add up the revenues of the semiconductor, electronic storage, software and other such technologically deflating industries.&nbsp; As of 2020, this calculation comes to about $2.7 Trillion/year, or 3% of World GDP.&nbsp; This figure was just 2% of World GDP when the first version of this publication was released in 2016, just 1% in 2004, and only about 0.5% of World GDP in 1992, so rapidly deflating products and components are becoming an ever-rising percentage of all economic output.&nbsp; If the proportion doubles again in the same pattern, then it could be 6% of World GDP by 2030 or so, and continuing to rise after that.</p>
<p>This progressing convergence of World GDP with technology is exceedingly important to every aspect of the future economy, from central bank monetary easing to inflation/deflation to the fiscal health of governments.&nbsp; Since almost every new product or service is created and delivered through a process that uses increasing levels of technology, this phenomenon is getting woven into the fabric of everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Panoply of Creative Destruction : &nbsp;</strong>Words like ‘disruption’ and ‘destruction’ are usually associated with negative events.&nbsp; This consequently leads many to have a subconscious aversion to technological progress.&nbsp; There is insufficient understanding of Joseph Schumpeter’s concept of ‘Creative Destruction’, where the process of technological change topples existing norms and replaces them with new ones in a new power hierarchy.&nbsp; A great book and documentary series to examine is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-We-Got-Now-Innovations/dp/161176338X">‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">How We Got to Now’ by Steven Johnson</span></a>.&nbsp; Mr. Johnson chronicles the iterative and messy process through which light, sound, time, and other fundamentals were eventually harnessed for modern human use.&nbsp; The accelerating rate of change is visible across his narration of historical events, and his work is an excellent prequel to the subject matter we are about to examine.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20278801d4b53200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20278801d4b53200d img-responsive" alt="Technology-adoption-by-households-in-the-united-states-768x542" title="Technology-adoption-by-households-in-the-united-states-768x542" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20278801d4b53200d-500wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a>Proceeding to the present, it is not technological disruption that is new, but the exponentially rising <em>rate</em> of change means more sectors, businesses, and lives are being transformed at greater speed through an ever-widening cascade of disruptions. &nbsp;This chart from BlackRock displays the rising speed of proliferation of each new disruptive technology.&nbsp; The effect is not even fully captured in this US-only chart, since a worldwide chart, which I could not locate, would reveal an even faster acceleration.&nbsp; The accelerating rate of change is visible here as well, and a continuation of this trend indicates that upcoming technologies will vault from 0% to 50%-80% penetration within just a few years.</p>
<p>This effect can be across industries that have been unperturbed for decades, or by the creation of entirely new industries altogether.&nbsp; Furthermore, for the very first time, evidence is emerging that seemingly unrelated disruptions have some degree of interconnectedness with each other.</p>
<p>Incumbents often go to great lengths to suppress disruptions, even if they themselves attained the position through some previous disruption.&nbsp; Whenever an incumbent industry has a misguided belief that disruption can be prevented outright by going to the government to get protectionist barriers erected around it, that industry merely experiences a temporary delay in the disruption, after which the reversion to the trendline is necessarily sharper.&nbsp; The script unfolds predictably.&nbsp; The incumbents focus more on political favors than innovation, which is usually a poor strategy when multiple industries are simultaneously seeking favors from the same government.&nbsp; In the meantime, the successors ascend to great heights at a speed the regulatory complex cannot handle, and the entire situation becomes more headline-grabbing than it otherwise may have been.&nbsp; Examples of such industries include publishing, taxis, and universities, all of which predictably ended up seeing their disruption happen in a compressed time, with the post-disruption landscape ending up where the general trendline would have predicted anyway.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley continues to be ‘ground zero’ for creative destruction, but there are many other innovators in various locations across the globe, quietly tinkering on something that could topple a major incumbent thousands of miles away.&nbsp; Quite a bit of disruption happens from incremental refinements crossing a certain threshold, rather than a radical new product category, and hence Asia is a major source of disruptive sparks in its own right.</p>
<p>Just a few of the examples of creative destruction that are currently underway include :</p>
<p>1) Artificial Intelligence (AI), after decades of quiet progress unnoticed by those outside the field, is now on the brink of making an immense economic impact, due to both parallel computing and big data both reaching cost effectiveness as enabling technologies.&nbsp; Many aspects of productivity can be greatly accelerated in a manner that is orthogonal and complementary to most other professions and industries.&nbsp; This empowers one person to do the job of four in some cases, or to embark on an entirely new type of career in others.&nbsp; On one hand, it is exciting to anticipate the trillions of dollars of output that will soon be generated with minimal input.&nbsp; On the other hand, input-optimization is a fancy way of saying that millions of jobs might get displaced.&nbsp; While new, higher-paying jobs will be created in different fields and different countries, the same workers cannot simply transition to those new jobs, nor is the creation immediate after the displacement of the old jobs.</p>
<p>AI is the single biggest disruption on the horizon, as it directly affects the greatest number of jobs across almost all industries.&nbsp; It could simultaneously lead to a dividend of productivity that can flow more freely across borders than most other types of productivity.&nbsp; The dichotomy of AI will cause great confusion to readers of media output from the dueling camps.&nbsp; This topic will be specifically addressed in more detail later in this publication, for AI is the conduit via which fundamental modernization of the state's function and fiscal flows will become inevitable.</p>
<p>2) 3D Printing accelerates many aspects of design, prototyping, and manufacturing, enabling greatly improved or even entirely new processes, products, and services.&nbsp; From this, the thresholds of fixed cost and economies of scale can lower to unprecedented levels, decentralizing and democratizing all aspects of manufacturing.&nbsp; This transforms everything from commodity consumer goods to international supply chains to the production of aircraft, spacecraft, and buildings.</p>
<p>The technology can now print in over 200 different materials representing a wide range of cost and durability.&nbsp;<a href="https://kprize.wordpress.com/prize-specifications/">‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personal Manufacturing</span>’</a> will soon be&nbsp;accessible to average households.&nbsp; An individual could download a design and print it at home or the corner store, rather than be restricted to only those products that can be mass produced.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many complicated shapes that could never have been produced as single units can now be printed, greatly increasing the speed and flexibility of manufacturing.&nbsp; Certain aspects of construction can take a major leap forward, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2008/09/can-buildings-be-printed.html">it is quite possible that by 2025, construction of basic structures takes less than one third the time that it does today</a></span>.&nbsp; This, of course, will deflate the value of all existing buildings in the world at that time, as is expected of any commodity in the in the economics of the third millennium.</p>
<p>3) Computing itself is on the brink of its first major transition in about 60 years.&nbsp; Semiconductors may no longer be able to further shrink transistors after around 2021 or so, finally retiring the venerable trend described by Moore’s Law.&nbsp; This is not the obituary of technological progress, as Moore’s Law is not the first, but rather the fifth paradigm of computing (as Ray Kurzweil has elaborated upon in detail in his books).&nbsp; The low-cost parallel computing enabled by NVidia's GPU allowed computing to advance on a vector no longer bottlenecked by transistor sizes (neural networks that run AI are more suited for parallel computing).&nbsp; Hence, transitioning to a successor to semiconductors is just the next handoff.&nbsp; Integration of discrete computing components such as the CPU, GPU, Memory, and Storage into a single unit will be another revolution in computing efficiency, enabled by new computing paradigms.&nbsp; &nbsp;Technologies like memristors may have a major role in this consolidation, as well as capturing an additional dimension of gains (literally) from their suitability for 3D chipsets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing">Quantum Computing</a></span>, an entirely different approach to computing, is no longer mere science fiction.&nbsp; Quantum computing functions by chaining together ‘qu-bits’, which unlike digital bits, can reside in a state of ‘0’ and ‘1’ at the same time.&nbsp; The power of the chain rises as an exponent of the number of the qu-bits that are chained together, and as the ability to create longer chains arises, quantum computing can greatly surpass the power of any conceivable digital computer.&nbsp; By some estimates, this may be possible by the 2030s, enabling multiple branches and technologies of computing to reside in different niches.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: right;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e202c8d3b6833f200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e202c8d3b6833f200b img-responsive" alt="MOOCs" title="MOOCs" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e202c8d3b6833f200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>4) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2014/07/the-education-disruption-2015.html">Education, both higher and lower, is being disrupted by the day</a></span>.&nbsp; The education sector has long operated under the fundamentally flawed principle that the cost of the same educational program can rise over time.&nbsp; To the contrary, costs should naturally decline over time, <em>since education is just another form of information and thus governed by the same forces of transmission as other information technologies</em>.&nbsp; Compounding the certainty of their imminent disruption, many universities, overconfident about their irreplaceable status in American society, have bloated their cost structures with excessive administrative personnel.&nbsp; These administrators have, in turn, taken on a role of political activism that has muddled the priorities of many universities away from education and career preparation.</p>
<p>In the meantime, several companies have produced courses and even entire degrees that can be completed online at the fraction of the cost of an in-residence degree and without the need for relocation.&nbsp; Employers such as Google have moved quickly to recognize these alternatives as legitimate substitutes to traditional credentials when evaluating potential hires.&nbsp; Such employers effectively indicate that a debt-free candidate at age 19 might have the same chance of getting an entry-level position as a debt-laden candidate at age 22.&nbsp; After initial resistance, other industries will gradually follow suit when they see enough LinkedIn profiles of successful Google employees without degrees.&nbsp; Eventually, many high-paying careers will require educational preparation that need not be expensive at all.&nbsp; These careers will in turn pull away bright adolescents from careers that may require massive student loan debt.</p>
<p>This example is particularly effective in demonstrating how the ATOM is self-reinforcing.&nbsp; The fields that among the most relevant to technological progress, such as Computer Science, are the ones most suitable for being delivered via low-cost, online degrees, attracting more students away from less ATOM-infused fields.&nbsp; Additionally, the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 may just be the tipping point that moves a large portion of education to the more efficient and pragmatic online model, since many schools and universities have been forced to shutter for months.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other dimension of ATOM acceleration of education is personalization through AI.&nbsp; Classroom-based methods are suited to only one learning style, when there are in fact over 50 different learning styles.&nbsp; As online educational tools use AI to customize to a student's learning style, the software draws from the experience of all other students of that style to adapt to each successive student, removing the problem of geographical dispersion of people with similar learning styles.&nbsp; As this sort of AI progresses, the speed of learning for users of such AI could rise 25-50% or more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) The transportation sector is currently a nexus of several simultaneous technological overhauls.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.popsci.com/car-disrupted-3-d-print-your-own-supercar">Strong, light nanomaterials are entering the bodies of&nbsp;cars to increase fuel efficiency and safety</a></span>.&nbsp; Engines are migrating to hybrid and electrical forms and reducing energy wastage through new design innovations, with electric vehicles now comprising 3% of new cars sold in 2020.&nbsp; New models of ride-sharing such as Uber will alter assumptions about car ownership while monetizing unused seats.&nbsp; The declining price of computing ensures that the timeline for luxury features to trickle down to average cars continues to compress.&nbsp; The $25,000 car of 2025 will be superior to the $50,000 car of 2000 in almost every technical measure.</p>
<p>By many accounts, consumer behavior has altered to where people consider it normal to ‘upgrade’ their perfectly functioning 8-year-old cars to a newer model with better electronic features.&nbsp;&nbsp;This may seem odd, but people did not tend to replace fully functional television sets before they failed until the 2004-05 thin-TV disruption, and the same product lifecycle dynamic will manifest with automobiles.</p>
<p>By 2032, self-driving cars will be readily available to the average US consumer, and will constitute a significant fraction of cars on the highway.&nbsp; The savings from self-driving cars will be manifold, from quicker commutes to fewer traffic fatalities to less pressure to widen roads (at a cost of $10M/mile or more).&nbsp; Self-driving cars will revise existing assumptions about highway speeds and acceptable commute distances.&nbsp; This effect of a ‘longer leash’ will whittle down real estate prices of expensive areas, which are expensive partly due to pre-ATOM transportation assumptions.</p>
<p>6) The financial services industry currently charges $600 Billion in fees for the $20 Trillion in annual worldwide credit/debit card transactions.&nbsp; This is a legacy of a structure established in an era when computing power needed to process transactions was expensive.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://time.com/3949469/financial-technology-boom/">Today, several ventures are seeking to modernize transactions to eliminate this cut that ensconced incumbents take</a></span>.&nbsp; Major financial services companies may see shrinkages in revenue, and will have to innovate and create new value-added services.&nbsp; The companies that do a better job of this than their competitors will accrue all of the industry profits, while the others will go bust.</p>
<p>Other product areas of ‘Fintech’ involve reducing the hefty costs and fees associated with mutual funds, custom portfolios, and mortgage processing, where a number of startups have already emerged.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21677198-technology-behind-bitcoin-could-transform-how-economy-works-trust-machine">On the systemic side, an area of disruption is ‘distributed ledger’ technology</a></span>.&nbsp; A distributed ledger enables the formation of Smart Contracts.&nbsp; Such a capability provides a degree of transparency and incorruptibility that may dramatically reduce the cost of transactional security and contract integrity.&nbsp; Smart Contracts can automate many forms of contracts that are both expensive and available only in very granular, retail forms.&nbsp; For example, a lawyer may have a certain contract template, and then charges clients $6000 for each one, with only minimal customization.&nbsp; If he has 1000 clients over a few years, that is 1000 x $6000, or $6 million in fees.&nbsp; If 1000 such lawyers all do the same thing, then that is $6 billion in fees charged by 1000 lawyers to 1 million clients.&nbsp; Instead, a Smart Contract automates all this and delivers it at less than 1/1000th of the cost, eliminating almost $6 billion in cost across the economy, generating technological deflation, and increasing access of this sort of contract to people who were not willing or able to pay $6000 in the old order.&nbsp; This can be applied to a wide range of contracts, as well as government transactions such as registrations, filings, and the disbursement of benefits and grants.&nbsp; Many aspects of government efficiency (federal, state, local) could rise 25% or more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>7) In the healthcare sector<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/529011/can-technology-fix-medicine/">, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">there are a number of disruptions seeking to crack the innovation-obstructing walls erected across the industry in country after country</span></a>. &nbsp;This is a major front in the battle between technology and excessive graft/cronyism.&nbsp; The endless frustration that technology has not yet overcome these barriers to bring cost-deflation and market competition to an industry notoriously averse to them may be at a turning point within a few years.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a4fbd163200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20240a4fbd163200b img-responsive" alt="Cost_per_genome_feb2019" title="Cost_per_genome_feb2019" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a4fbd163200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a>The cost of genome sequencing <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.genome.gov/sites/default/files/inline-images/Sequencing_Cost_per_Genome_August2019_0.jpg">plunged by a factor of 1000 in an extraordinary 4-year burst from 2007 to 2011, and is still dropping further</a></span>.&nbsp; While this has not yet created proportional cost reductions across other parts of the healthcare sector due to the enabling components being more static, as those costs inch down, more people will sequence their genomes.&nbsp; From this, networks of common genetic patterns will form by the 2020s.&nbsp; This will accelerate research around the genetics of disease as medicine begins to take on a ‘search engine’ flavor.&nbsp; When AI enters the equation, as patients feed symptoms and photographs into some deep learning engine, the engine becomes better at diagnosing ailments, which increases broader usage, which increases the engine’s precision further in a self-reinforcing loop.&nbsp; A human doctor cannot assimilate the input of thousands of patients dispersed across various geographies, and the engine serving as the AI doctor can be accessed from home, at any hour, and certainly at much lower cost. &nbsp;As some physicians realize they need to practice medicine in collaboration with these new technologies, the more genome and AI savvy MDs will thrive, while those who still adhere to the paternalistic paradigm will be left behind.&nbsp; As the medical profession transforms from the greater proliferation of the ‘for patients, by patients’ medium of knowledge, this will begin to lower costs.</p>
<p>Another disruption is surgical robotics, where incisions can be small and precise&nbsp;instead of large enough for the surgeon’s hands.&nbsp; This minimally invasive approach reduces risks and recovery times of major surgeries by 50-90%.&nbsp; Intuitive Surgical, the premier manufacturer of surgical robots, currently holds many key patents in this sector.&nbsp; As their patents expire, the cost of surgical robots will drop greatly as more entrants into the marketplace generate competition and make up for lost time.&nbsp; As more surgical robots connect to the cloud and begin to incorporate AI, the learnings of any one robot will immediately be available to every other robot accessing that repository of algorithms.</p>
<p>The persistent problem of healthcare innovation being obstructed by excessive government involvement in each transaction is the creation of the perverse situation where technological changes actually increase costs in the short term.&nbsp; This is because the weight of disruption is not yet enough to generate ‘cracks in the dam’ levels of pressure.&nbsp; As the scope of technological disruptions eventually becomes too much to regulate, the present disgrace will be overcome and will then finally see costs decline.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a4ae05d3200c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20240a4ae05d3200c img-responsive" alt="Swansons-law" title="Swansons-law" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a4ae05d3200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a>8) The energy sector is in the midst of numerous long-overdue disruptions that would take several pages to fully describe.&nbsp; The compound effect of multiple disruptions has introduced competition between sectors that were previously unrelated, in a superb example of how the ATOM works.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one of the most important predictions at The Futurist, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.singularity2050.com/2011/07/the-end-of-petrotyranny.html">I predicted, in early 2011, the permanent decline in oil prices, on account of Third Millennium Economic principles</a>.&nbsp; </span><a href="https://www.singularity2050.com/2016/03/the-end-of-petrotyranny-victory.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Oil is unlikely to rise above $70/barrel for a very long time, if ever</span>.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Electrical vehicles displace oil consumption with electricity, even while the electricity itself starts to be generated through solar, wind, and ultra-low-cost natural gas from hydraulic fracking technology.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.singularity2050.com/2020/02/atom-award-of-the-month-february-2020.html">Photovoltaics (PV), in particular, has been following a steady price decline trend for over 40 years under Swanson’s Law, and is soon going to be the most cost-competitive form of electricity in the lower latitudes that contain most of the world’s population</a></span>.&nbsp; Note the logarithmic scales on both axes of this chart, indicative of exceptionally rapid progress even by ATOM standards.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201bb090d6d44970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e201bb090d6d44970d img-responsive" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Lighting" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201bb090d6d44970d-320wi" alt="Lighting" /></a>The electrical economy will be further transformed by revolutions in&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/09/the_imminent_re.html">lighting</a></span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://evobsession.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lithium-ion-battery-experience-curve-800x601.png">batteries</a></span>, which will lower electrical bills, enable more accessibility to electricity in developing nations, and smooth out spikes that arise from supply-demand mismatches.</p>
<p>The creative destruction in energy will extend to the geopolitical landscape, where we see many petrostates much weaker in 2020 than they have been in decades.&nbsp; Eventually, very few countries will be reliant on energy that originates further than 2000 miles from their own borders, and the practice of transporting liquid hydrocarbons to another hemisphere will be seen for the strange historical aberration it is.</p>
<p>9) After decades of stagnation, space exploration is finally seeing a handoff from being the exclusive endeavor of 3-4 major governments to being a target for private enterprise.&nbsp; Private spaceflight is becoming cost-effective through companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX.&nbsp; From these flight capabilities, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://nypost.com/2015/12/12/the-coming-cosmic-gold-rush/">asteroid mining might be a decade away from yielding trillions of dollars of valuable elements from nearby asteroids</a></span>, which will of course crush the price of valuable metals on Earth, facilitating new industrial applications and more technological deflation.&nbsp; There is a particular interest in heavier (i.e. precious) elements that are rare in the Earth’s crust (having sunk to the center) but more common within certain asteroids due to lower mass and thus gravity.&nbsp; This could collapse the price of gold, platinum, and other metals due to the supply increase.</p>
<p>3D Printing adapted for space can construct elaborate structures in space itself merely by refilling the orbiting printer with printing filament, which is far easier than launching finished products from Earth.&nbsp; Large, orbiting mirrors might serve to reflect sunlight towards a desired location on the Earth’s surface, such as onto a major city during nighttime.&nbsp; The progress in semiconductors, storage, batteries, and data transmission is particularly valuable for space as it permits satellites and probes to shrink down to a mass that can be launched without rockets, while wireless software updates can upgrade them continuously from Earth.&nbsp; We are about to have thousands of times as many images from space, of objects never before imaged in such detail, as we have had in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e202c8d3b5aaad200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e202c8d3b5aaad200b img-responsive" alt="Retail" title="Retail" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e202c8d3b5aaad200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" width="247" height="182" /></a>10) E-commerce is not new, and was the basis of the 'dot-com bubble' of the Y2K era.&nbsp; However, the real value of e-commerce is not the mere ability to save retail overhead costs and have products delivered to the home.&nbsp; There is a second layer of value that is only being realized now, twenty years after the first wave.&nbsp; This value is from the data collection inherent to e-commerce.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been long known that companies like Google and Facebook provide their products and services for 'free' because they monetize user data.&nbsp; Amazon does this too, even though its products are not free.&nbsp; Amazon and other e-commerce retailers thus have the ability to undercut brick and mortar retail even further without incurring a loss, as the data layer is a second source of money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>E-commerce, prior to the coronavirus crisis, was about 12% of total US retail, and the coronavirus quarantine pushed it higher.&nbsp; Even after the crisis abates, it may stay at a permanently higher level on account of this fast-forwarding of growth.&nbsp; The shift away from brick and mortar retail has many effects, particularly in the United States, where allocation of land to physical retail is far higher than in most other countries.&nbsp; This land will have to be repurposed, which is a huge dividend of new land available for pressing contemporary uses, such as housing.&nbsp; Local governments are not dynamic enough to modernize zoning ordinances and permits to enable the free market to repurpose this resource at market speeds, so there could be disruptive pressure on this front as well, due to the gales of creative destruction unleashed by e-commerce's inexorable rise.&nbsp; The entire concept of suburbia, within a US context, will have to be reoriented and reimagined.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These disruptions are just some of the examples in the pipeline for the next few years, shaking the foundations of old, rigid structures.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.singularity2050.com/atom-aotm/">The ATOM Award of the Month (ATOM AotM) chronicles such disruptions across every possible sector, as well as their linkages to seemingly unrelated technological disruptions</a>.&nbsp; The common theme among all of them is their deflationary nature, and their process of destroying certain types of jobs while creating other jobs elsewhere at higher renumeration.&nbsp; This is creative destruction at its finest.</p>
<p>The typical process of creative destruction results in X wealth being destroyed in one sector, while 2X, 3X, or more wealth is created instead by different people in different sectors.&nbsp; For each of the disruptions listed above, ‘X’ might be a trillion dollars or more.&nbsp; Yet that is not even the best part, for each disruption exerts a reinforcing effect on every other nascent disruption, as each are dynamic components of the broader ATOM, and hence Third Millennium Economics.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>All Technological Disruptions are Interconnected</strong> :&nbsp; In the midst of a technological disruption, neither the incumbents nor the disruptors pay much attention to parallel creative destruction in distant industries and countries, under the assumption that it is entirely unrelated.&nbsp; On the contrary, my proprietary research has discovered that all technological advancement, and all creative destruction, is interlinked by varying degrees of distance.&nbsp; It is not a constellation of many isolated techno-centers operating in different industries and geographies, but one unified ATOM, where one successful cycle of creative destruction strengthens the prospects of each subsequent candidate technology in the pipeline, and the aggregate economic volume of such disruption rises exponentially.</p>
<p>One of best examples of this can be illustrated by returning to the example of the crude oil market.&nbsp; When oil prices began to rise around 2004, various people who project every trend linearly from a rear-view mirror analysis descended into hysteria about ‘peak oil’, with some going so far as to insist that economic prosperity would regress back to that of the 19<sup>th</sup> century once oil became 'too expensive'.&nbsp; By contrast, technologically and economically literate observers were untroubled, since they knew that higher oil prices would necessarily cause a market response across the entire phalanx of mitigating technologies from every direction.&nbsp; Drillers worked to improve their hydraulic fracking methods.&nbsp; Material scientists worked on lighter yet stronger materials for cars.&nbsp; Battery innovators worked to increase charge duration.&nbsp; Engine designers worked to increase engine efficiency through a re-imagining of the humble spark plug.&nbsp; Each group represented a component of a holistic response to expensive oil prices.&nbsp; As each column advanced on the problem from a different direction, speeding up as oil got more expensive, there was never any real chance of oil staying significantly above $110/barrel for a lengthy period, and as of early-mid 2020, it is down to a mere $20-25/barrel after years of ongoing disruption of oil supply <em>and</em> demand.&nbsp; Gold and copper may seem to have no relation to oil, but the same process of disruption manifested there as well.&nbsp; The high price of gold created a larger market window to prospect for more supply, and aerial drones increased prospecting efficiency by orders of magnitude in remote locations.</p>
<p>A second example, which happens to be imminent, is the retail sector of India.&nbsp; Anyone acquainted with India knows that the retail experience is still of a 19<sup>th</sup> century nature, with inconvenient layouts, cash payments, rude haggling, and prices varying by over 50% between merchants less than 100 meters apart.&nbsp; The supply chain is so inefficient that half of all fruits and vegetables rot before reaching the point of sale, and routine shopping that may take an hour in the US takes half a day in India.&nbsp; Since these ‘mom and pop’ operations are a powerful voting block, the government has erected steep barriers to obstruct the entry of foreign retail chains such as Wal-Mart and IKEA.&nbsp; These multinationals would, by their very operating presence, improve infrastructure, logistics, and price competition across India, yet this overdue progress is being thwarted through electoral politics.&nbsp; The ATOM, in response, has merely redirected to move the disruption to a higher, broader plane.&nbsp; If international-grade brick and mortar retail is being obstructed, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21693925-battle-indias-e-commerce-market-about-much-more-retailing-india-online">that makes it simultaneously easier for e-commerce to emerge</a></span>.&nbsp; If landline Internet proliferation was not rapid enough, the smartphone delivered wireless Internet access deep down the pyramid, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21693921-next-15-years-india-will-see-more-people-come-online-any-other-country-e-commerce">which in turn made e-commerce accessible</a></span>.&nbsp; This is one of the great examples of how the ATOM invariably bypasses obstructions in proportion to how stifling they are.&nbsp; In India today, the e-commerce sector is projected to grow at over 30%/year for the next few years, enabling an improvement across roads, consumer finance, and marketing, that otherwise was progressing at the most sclerotic of rates.</p>
<p>The same principles apply to more widely dispersed areas of innovation.&nbsp; As described above, many poorer countries are resistant to the implementation of even 20<sup>th</sup> century technologies.&nbsp; But as one product, the smartphone, managed to percolate through the dense barriers to reach people with no prior Internet access, cracks began to emerge in the technological time-capsules that such societies represent.&nbsp; Many other technologies are now gaining a long-overdue foothold even there through this new conduit of ATOM transmission.&nbsp; Apps to facilitate education, health, agriculture, and transportation can easily spread to a huge number of people who were far below the economic threshold one previously associated with advanced technology usage.&nbsp; Since the smartphone is often the first electricity-consuming device for some of these rural users, it forces the emergence of a power grid where there was none before.&nbsp; The government ineptitude that failed to provide electricity is bypassed by the decentralized nature of photovoltaics and the rapid price declines seen under Swanson’s Law.&nbsp; This in turn creates electrical power that in turn enables other devices to be used in these areas for the first time.</p>
<p>What this demonstrates is that the ATOM has a certain aggregate amount of disruptive capacity that rises each year with accelerating rates of technological progress.&nbsp; More specifically, the magnitude of each individual disruption at a particular time determines how much of the ATOM is occupied until the disruption manifests, after which that portion of the ATOM moves on to the next disruption.&nbsp; By monitoring and measuring the various instances of creative destruction underway at any given time, one can estimate both the size of the ATOM and the force it will exert on subsequent disruptions once the completion of current disruptions frees up ATOM capacity.&nbsp; If toppling a formidable problem like $110+ oil occupied a substantial fraction of the ATOM for over 7 years, then the completion of that disruption frees up that portion of the ATOM for the next one.&nbsp; This could be one similarly huge obstacle or a dozen smaller ones.</p>
<p>Under the concept of human civilization merging with technology prophesized by Ray Kurzweil, this could be the early evidence of a unifying fabric of technology that leads to a ‘Technological Singularity’ in a few decades time.&nbsp; While that topic is beyond the scope of this publication (see my <a href="https://www.singularity2050.com/2019/08/timing-the-singularity-v-20.html">Singularity article here</a>), what is apparent now is how a pipeline of disruption, and the allocation of the ATOM between them based on how sweeping, complex, and ‘due’ the disruption is, can be estimated.&nbsp; This provides a path to more precise forecasts.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Creative Destruction and Human Collateral Damage :</strong> &nbsp;While the gains of wealth and productivity look excellent at the highest level of macroeconomic statistics, the human cost incurred by the sifting sands are a different matter.&nbsp; By current trends, the US economy seems mired in a&nbsp;long-term status quo where vanishing industries force many&nbsp;laid off workers&nbsp;to start in new industries&nbsp;at the entry level&nbsp;for half of their previous compensation.&nbsp; The net new wealth created by the new industries often does not reach the average household.</p>
<p>One could declare that income diversification is the golden rule of the early 21st century, and those who fail to create and maintain multiple streams of income are imperiling themselves.&nbsp; In such a climate, the best career one can embark on, which will never be obsolete, is that of the serial entrepreneur.&nbsp; This is true, but not everyone is cut out to be an entrepreneur, or has the cushion of savings that could enable them to pursue entrepreneurship.&nbsp; Furthermore, the current tax code is not friendly towards entrepreneurship at all.&nbsp; Hence, only a fraction of the people who could succeed as entrepreneurs are in fact full-time entrepreneurs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US citizenry often sees a baffling paradox of weak employment and low labor force participation despite high corporate earnings growth.&nbsp; Technological disruption is blamed for this without simultaneously being praised for the new jobs it creates.&nbsp;&nbsp;Big paydays for entrepreneurs will make the headlines frequently, right alongside stories of people who saw their entire profession vanish and have not found new employment for years.&nbsp; This has been sheepishly designated as the ‘new normal’, complete with an industry devoted to directing opprobrium to designated scapegoats.&nbsp; But given what we have seen about the accelerating rate of economic growth, this is certainly not where the trendline should have delivered us by now.</p>
<p>Amidst these sweeping waves of technology, human society is stratifying.&nbsp; Some people find this creative destruction to be exhilarating, while others find this to be extremely stressful.&nbsp; Given how complicated and unpredictable these economic reorientations appear to the majority of people, the role of government has to be to cushion the process of creative destruction in a very agnostic yet acceleration-aware manner.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the ATOM has an economic effect analogous to a double-edged sword.&nbsp; Technology leads to ever-rising rates of economic growth, but also causes disruptions that lead to stress and uncertainty.&nbsp; If only there were a set of ideas that could enhance the former while minimizing the latter properties of technology.&nbsp; If we could monetize the accelerating rate of technological change in a manner that reduces, rather than increases, the dislocation stresses that workers face from this process of creative destruction.&nbsp; Despite this, the last thing the government should do is attempt to pick winners and losers, for this is a moral hazard that weakens the system and the faith that people have in it.&nbsp; Fortunately, there are a few solutions available, both comprehensive and efficient.</p>

I should add, I have an Apple 5 phone.  The 6 is better....but why bother?

Again, as I posted before, infinite growth requires infinite needs.  And My iPhone 5 pretty much does everything I could ever want.  I have a hard time imagining buying a faster, better phone.  How many nanoseconds must be shaved from search?

We may be satisfied before we reach the technological limits, which may in turn slow progress and growth.

The jobs that will be lost will be on the menial end of things - fast food, truck driving, etc.  People don't realize we manufacture just as much as we ever did, but with fewer and fewer people.  Offshoring will end once the robots come, but entire factories will be run by a dozen people.

There will become a class of people nobody wants - the unintelligent and uncreative.  The only solution I can see is a universal minimum income. Or perhaps a requirement for a certain number of community service hours for each person, in exchange for a paycheck.

I have noticed a distinct rise in blue collar love - shows about people renovating houses, cutting logs, mining.  We become ever more jealous of people not slaved to a computer. People who can work with their hands will be considered part of the upper class, while keyboard surfers will be relegated to the soon to lose their jobs....I guess my point is, it doesn't have to be the way most people imagine - the guy fixing a toilet may become the most valuable commodity in an accelerating world...

A valuable commode commodity...

Geoman,

Yes.  See Chapter 4, and the '$10 Trillion of output with one person employed' line.  

The only solution I can see is a universal minimum income. 

Hence the DUES, and the exponentially rising nature of it.  Remember that when two gang-member teenagers shoot each other, the cost to the taxpayer is several times more than the two shooters could ever generate in their lives.  DUES somewhat reduces that.  

We may be satisfied before we reach the technological limits, which may in turn slow progress and growth.

The world is still only at $11,000 per capita PPP, so there is a lot more growth to go on a worldwide basis, even if only to elevate emerging markets to US levels.  The question is whether that is the ceiling, and the US is near to it.  

To examine that, think of how when a product category saturates, new ones arrive to generate new demand.  The desktop PC saturated as you described, then the laptop (which used to be much more expensive), now the phone and tablet.  VR is the next big consumer hardware category, and will generate hundreds of billions of $ of new revenue until it, too, reaches a plateau, and so on.  

When more health treatments emerge, they will be expensive but the wealthy will spend money on them, as another example of new demand..

I see relatively few wealthy Americans deciding to stop working.  The vast majority of them keep on going, long after they have no financial reason to...

Well, you see the people that make that decision, what you don't see are those that chose not to continue.  I know several, including 2 cousins that basically decided at 50 to take up golfing since they had more than enough money to service their needs indefinitely.

<i>I know several, including 2 cousins that basically decided at 50 to take up golfing since they had more than enough money to service their needs indefinitely.</i>

That is still uncommon, as a percentage.  Plus, don't underestimate how many of them would go back to work if the <b>income tax rate were zero</b> and NGDP was 6-7% rather than 3%.  If any of them have any alimony or child support obligations, however small, that further forces a decision like the one you described.  

There were tons of books written in the 19th century about how when basic necessities were met for most people, most would stop working (and the definition of basic necessities at the time would seem very modest today).  That did not happen.  

Plus, you are forgetting :

1) The DUES is not that large for a long time yet.  It is only $400/month in 2016, and does not rise to $100,000+ until the mid-2030s.
2) In America, 75% of all govt. spending is <b>already</b> a transfer between individuals.  Your complaint has to take into account from what baseline we are starting.  
3) Income taxes going to 0% changes everything, incentive-wise.  
4) A fear of too many people choosing not to work is mutually exclusive with a fear that too many jobs are being replaced with automation.

Consider the combination of all factors.

They can find very real motivation as literally their lifes will depend on their income. Say you can grow an artificial heart/ling/leaver for 10 million dollars.

Re-reading,one thing that leaps out at me is "since education is just another form of information and thus governed by the same forces of transmission as other information technologies" as an incorrect assumption - there was a long emphasis on people reading books and learning from them, but the goal was transformation, even if the more common result was sorting, credentialling and often warehousing people.  Sorting and credentialling are information activities, but transformation and warehousing are not.  This is the area that we have been waiting for the snap back the longest, and even now, the trouble the higher education industry is not facing is better alternatives, but that credentialling is less useful as it becomes more and more common - and thus contains less useful information.

Drew,

The process of education has increased in accessibility and lowered in price.  However, for some students, college is a luxury consumption good (further confirmed by the recent scandal), so they are not price-sensitive.  But the fact that admission was the only hurdle, and even very subpar students faced no risk of not graduating further exposes how decoupled the credential has become from a) education, and b) rigor.

I like these arguments but I come back to two concerns.

The first is that of limited physical space and resources.  We can all have the fancier gadgets, but there isn't room for everyone to have a detached house in the city.  Your point about self-driving cars opening up longer commutes and thus more land is a good one, but it brings me to my second concern:

Whatever efficiencies we find to meet a physical-resource-limited need will cause an increase in population such that the per capita need will return to the pre-efficiency-finding level.  More land I can commute to, that's good, but once it's all bought up how does that help the next generation who is priced out?

Higher density housing is a practical option of course, but it is a decrease in quality of life, which if I understand right this philosophy doesn't necessarilly call for.

Do you see any natural limits to population, and thus its ability to neutralize the per capita quality of life improvements coming from efficiency gains?

Apologies if you cover this in more detail later in the series.

DTM,

<i>Whatever efficiencies we find to meet a physical-resource-limited need will cause an increase in population such that the per capita need will return to the pre-efficiency-finding level.</i>

Excluding SS-Africa, the entire rest of the world combined is at sub-replacement fertility rates.  

The US, at least, is nowhere close to this problem.  Remember, not everyone dislikes higher density.  Single people like it more (more new people to meet), and fewer and fewer people are marrying at all.

<i>Do you see any natural limits to population, </i>

In theory, yes, but as the RoW excluding SS-Africa is already below replacement rate, this is not a worry.

That is heartening about overall population growth.

I do take your point that some like density, but in crowded tech centers like SF, Boston, and Toronto the demand for less dense housing far outstrips supply.  Cities like that by the way are the problematic cases; even if worldwide opulation is plateauing, the populations of those cities are growing because that's where jobs can be found.

Perhaps in the future tech jobs will no longer cluster in a few major cities?  I know that tech tends to cluster because employers and employees are drawn to the large available pools of each other, but I've often wondered why some companies don't move to an area with cheaper COL, pay 2/3 as much (with which their employees can live like kings), and proceed to destroy their competition.

<p style="text-align: right;">– &nbsp;Friedrich Nietzsche</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zvovrd97ADA">(Video)</a></span>. &nbsp;The first and most important concept to internalize is the accelerating rate of change.&nbsp; This is a very under-discussed subject even though it increasingly affects almost everything about modern life.&nbsp; One of the best places to read about this is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns">Ray Kurzweil’s 2001 essay</a></span>, despite the age of the article (the conspicuous dearth of more recent writings by multiple people is itself a problem that this publication aims to correct).&nbsp; From his essay, we see how technological progress is accelerating, multi-faceted, and diverse.&nbsp; The essay also proves that technological progress is not in stagnation or reversal, as some claim.&nbsp; It is important to note how exponentially accelerating processes have been going on since the dawn of life on Earth, and through the evolution of life, with each unit of change taking even smaller intervals of time.&nbsp; That process has continued through measures of progress within human society as well, especially in economics and technology.&nbsp; In this chapter, we will specifically focus on the economic evidence of accelerating change, for no other metric does more to demonstrate how fortunate we are to be alive in the 21<sup>st </sup>century.</p>
<p>For now, we will use the customary metric of ‘Real’ GDP growth rates (i.e. inflation adjusted), while later explaining why the less famous but more natural measurement of Nominal GDP (NGDP), despite including inflation, is the more relevant measurement for the future.&nbsp; ‘Real’ GDP overstates the dangers of moderate inflation, while understating the dangers of negative inflation (deflation), ironically making it less real, in an era of high technology.&nbsp; Furthermore, is GDP even the correct metric anymore?&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.aei.org/publication/another-limitation-of-gdp-accounting-it-fails-to-capture-improvements-in-economic-well-being-in-the-information-age/">GDP is calculated in a manner that favors doing ‘even more with more’ to a greater degree than it favors doing ‘the same with less’, while technology is primarily about the latter.</a></span>&nbsp; It is also true that GDP does not always provide the most precise measure of prosperity, for which indices like the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index">Human Development Index</a></span> are more comprehensive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asset prices (the stock market, real estate, etc.) are a far better metric of actual progress, since both the positive (exponential growth) and the negative (inequality of gains) are captured more accurately.&nbsp; Plus, the combined price of assets cannot be distorted by deficit spending.&nbsp; But for lack of a better alternative in tracking centuries of progress as stock market data does not go back nearly as far, we will use GDP for the purposes of these calculations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Economic Growth Through the Ages :</strong> &nbsp;Everyone has studied historical events in school, passing exams and even writing papers.&nbsp; Contemporary schooling barely describes the greatest historical transformation of all time – the very recent upliftment of the human condition.&nbsp; An education about historical events is utterly incomplete without a sufficient illustration of the prosperity levels of the era. &nbsp;This backdrop has to go far deeper than a ‘there were no airplanes in those days’ level of cursory mention, for only then can the conditions precipitating wars over resources, slavery, etc. be truly grasped. &nbsp;Romanticizing the imagery of some past society invariably necessitates a selective focus on the topmost aristocrats, while ignoring the brutal and brief lives that the other 99% were condemned to. &nbsp;Effectively, any lament about ‘how good things were then’ is an inaccurate fictionalization.</p>
<p>We are presently accustomed to per capita real growth rates of almost 3%/year for the world economy and consider this to be a status quo cruising speed, as though such a growth rate has always existed.&nbsp; In reality, such growth rates did not begin until the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.&nbsp; In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, the average world growth rate was much lower, at about 1%/year.&nbsp; Before that, annual growth rates were a fraction of 1% from the 16<sup>th</sup> through the 18<sup>th</sup> centuries, and virtually 0% for the thousands of years of human civilization before that.&nbsp; The accelerating rate of economic growth (which is the <em>second</em> derivative, mind you) has not stopped, despite how lackluster present conditions may feel.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a500cb2c200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20240a500cb2c200b image-full img-responsive" alt="Exponent" title="Exponent" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a500cb2c200b-800wi" border="0" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a></p>
<p>Let us examine the above two charts (click to expand), which indicate world GDP in current dollars on a linear scale 1960-2018, and then the S&amp;P500 stock market index, 1939-2019.&nbsp; The exponential nature of economic growth is apparent from both charts, but each depicts the trajectory in a different light.&nbsp; If you projected the same trend forward just a few more years, we can see that a much higher level of prosperity arrives in force, particularly with the more accurate indicator of the stock market.&nbsp; The topic of adjusting for inflation may arise, but as we will see in a later section, current methods of calculating inflation overstate inflation rates, and are thus starting to become obsolete.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a4f92e22200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20240a4f92e22200b img-responsive" alt="Years ago from 2050-Linear" title="Years ago from 2050-Linear" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a4f92e22200b-500wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a>We have world GDP estimates going back centuries, and if we take a simple linear regression of past data and project it until the year 2050, on a third chart with a logarithmic scale on the vertical axis, we get a window into the future.&nbsp; We can examine this even more effectively with the horizontal axis oriented as looking backwards from the present, with green as what has actually occurred, and blue as a mere projection of the trendline.&nbsp; Note the parabolic curve despite the scale being logarithmic, effectively exhibiting a second derivative of exponential growth.&nbsp; The accelerating nature of economic growth, going back centuries, is apparent when the chart is presented in this way, and proves that it could not have existed until recently.</p>
<p>Imagine if 3% annual growth rates in per capita GDP, implying a doubling every 24 years, had started from 500 BC, resulting in over 105 doublings by now.&nbsp; Or imagine if it had started from 1500 AD or even from just 1800 AD, which would still have yielded nine doublings since then, resulting in a growth factor of an incredible 512x.&nbsp; The evidence is indisputable that the current growth rates have only begun very recently.&nbsp; Since growth rates of this nature were never possible before the modern era, the second-derivative indicates that there is no reason to think the trendline has stopped or even plateaued.&nbsp; The key word here is <em>trendline</em>, as distinct from actual data.</p>
<p><br /><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a4f92e26200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20240a4f92e26200b img-responsive" alt="Years ago from 2050-Linear2" title="Years ago from 2050-Linear2" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20240a4f92e26200b-500wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a>If thousands of years of nearly 0% growth can be followed by a century of 1%, several decades of 2%, and then another few decades of 3% growth, simple mathematical extrapolation of that trend implies much higher growth rates in the near future.&nbsp; This fourth chart is an extension of the same chart backwards 2500 years.&nbsp; As we can see, the steep trajectory of growth has never, at any time, halted or reversed.&nbsp; In terms of simple multipliers, the rise from 1% to 3% trendline growth is no different, proportionally, than a rise from 3% to 9% growth later on in the curve.&nbsp; Mathematically, this should not seem any more rapid for the estimated year the curve intersects than today’s growth rates would have seemed in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.&nbsp; You may be skeptical about this if you have not read the later chapters in this publication yet.&nbsp; Is an unstoppable progression of ever-rising growth rates a believable outcome?&nbsp; Since past performance is not always a predictor of future outcomes, surely we cannot just project the trendline to a point where in just a few decades even ordinary people are destined to have great prosperity.&nbsp; Is there some ceiling of human productivity that we have arrived at?&nbsp; How will most people acquire the skills to produce that much output?&nbsp; Is it not inevitable for the law of large numbers to eventually catch up, even if an identical skeptic in the 19<sup>th</sup> century would have been proven wrong had he dismissed an accurate prediction of 2020 prosperity as too optimistic?</p>
<p>The crucially unpredictable ingredient in such projections is that of nation-state risk.&nbsp; Economic growth within an individual country does not just happen without the right set of conditions.&nbsp; Sometimes, the wrong policies, centralized micromanagement, or ossified assumptions can lead to economic declines such as the Great Depression.&nbsp; Recoveries since these calamities have generally returned world GDP back to the trendline as though the crisis never happened, with the more accurate metric of asset prices rebounding to the trendline even faster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But some nations often leapfrog others in the process of the global mean-reversion, capturing a disproportionate share of the recovery.&nbsp; The most prominent example is of how China and India jointly declined from being 40% of world GDP in 1820 to just 2% in 1975, even as the aggregate world GDP trendline was a smooth exponential curve throughout that period.&nbsp; This period was essentially the ‘Dark Ages’ for China and India, precisely coinciding with when the West was outperforming by the greatest margin.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">T<a href="https://www.singularity2050.com/2018/07/economic-trendline-reversion-does-not-happen-evenly.html">he rapid recoveries of China and to a lesser extent India since then can be seen as the start of a process of mean reversion to historical norms of GDP share, assisted by the steeply rising world trendline</a></span>.&nbsp; The two nations are now jointly 20% of world GDP, and may very well recover all the way up to the traditional 40% in a matter of just years, not decades or centuries.</p>
<p>There is reason to believe that the economy may force a toppling of obstacles preventing the trendine from reverting back to its natural state.&nbsp; So far, this trajectory has reverted to the exponential trendline through world wars, economic depressions, plagues, and the dissolution of empires.</p>
<p>Yet most advanced and even middle-income countries today somehow appear to be stuck in a lengthy malaise of sub-par GDP growth, combined with little or no inflation.&nbsp; There seems to be a resigned acceptance of a melancholy ‘Real’ per capita growth rate of under 2% in the US, and under 1% in Europe, even though this is less than what was seen in the 1990s.&nbsp; The default assumption appears to be that this will be the norm for the foreseeable future, in direct violation of the expected accelerating gradient of growth.&nbsp; Even worse, the Nominal GDP that the US normally sees has fallen from over 6% prior to 2007 to under 4% now, which adds a poorly understood but nonetheless substantial damper on economic vibrancy and the pace of innovation.&nbsp; As more years of this divergence accumulate, the opportunity cost is rising.&nbsp; The world can no longer afford to continue to ignore how technology has altered the fundamentals of macroeconomics.</p>

One thought has troubled me for some time in measuring wealth and growth.  In the past there was a long way to go for someone to feel wealthy.  There were tangible improvements to lifespan, health, welfare, etc. associated with great wealth.  Therefore increases in GDP were directly tied to the happiness of people, and tangible improvements to their lives.

What is it like when we live in a world where being a millionaire is not a particularly important accomplishment?  I live in a modest neighborhood, and my neighbor is fairly wealthy.  he stills lives in his modest, but greatly improved, house.  He also has a vacation home in a sunnier clime.  He has a nice car.  But...he admits, he doesn't really have any use for most of his wealth. He literally cannot not consume enough things to diminish it, or even put a dent in it.  

How does this impact GDP?  When more and more people have all their modest materiel wants satisfied?

My neighbor, when he made enough money to be comfortable (not more than $5 million), stopped working for the most part.  Oh he plays around a bit, but really, he doesn't work that hard.  Not as hard as he did when he made his money.  he is underproductive, and is an underperforming asset.  he is a drag on the growth of GDP.  whatever avarice he once had is gone.  he has satisfied all his needs.  At best he works part time.

I guess the point I'm trying to make is that accumulated wealth slows growth. Success doesn't always build on success, it can lead to stagnation.  My neighbor is the very definition of doing less with more, which is not something most economists consider.

"Is there some ceiling of human productivity that we have arrived at?"  Yes, based on my example, I think so.  The limit is us unfortunately - how much we can or want to consume.  All exponential growth curves eventually morph into S-curves.

"Sometimes, the wrong policies, centralized micromanagement, or ossified assumptions can lead to economic declines such as the Great Depression." or Venezuela.  seriously, could there be a better example of how government policies and economic mismanagement can roll back prosperity?  Venezuela was, for decades, a decidedly middle income country.  Now it is a basket case.  In less than a decade, utterly ruined.

Another strange effect of technology is people "feeling" wealthier than they truly are.  For example, overseas travel used to be for the rich and famous.  Then became a middle income activity with cheap jet travel.  Now...with VR, anyone can see whatever part of the world they wish.  Sure you could still go there, but the point is that you feel richer, that the poor can do more, experience more with even a limited income.

So I guess part of what may be hurting nominal GPD is the mere fact that it no longer accurately measures our wealth.  Upper middle income people feel progressively more wealthy due to technology, and because of this take their foot off the gas, much like my neighbor did.

I guess, to summarize further, I'm saying that GDP growth is in part psychological.  It is driven by human wants and desires.  These are not exponential, and have quantifiable limits.

Geoman,

Yes, there are many limits to GDP as a metric.  Even more than some people feeling wealthy (most of the ultrawealthy still work hard), part of the problem is in the manner it is calculated.

There are a variety of new products your neighbor can buy when innovation makes them available, such as household robots to clean the bathroom (replacing the person he hires), longevity treatments, self-driving cars (which will have a high premium for a while still), etc.  

VR does indeed commoditize many types of recreation and experiences, as the brain will 'feel' as though the person has indeed done that thing for real.  Not many understand the disruptive effect of VR on seemingly unrelated things like real estate prices, the travel industry, male-female interactions, etc.

Btw, can you give an estimate from ATOM's point of view why the world GDP per capita growth has stagnated from 1994 to 2002. That was the time of personal computer s becoming mainstream and spectacular show of Moore's law. And yet the char shows a decade of virtually no growth...

Fatcat,

<i>Btw, can you give an estimate from ATOM's point of view why the world GDP per capita growth has stagnated from 1994 to 2002.</i>

It was due to the wind down and breakup of the USSR, which led to low GDP growth in all associated countries for the following decade.  It was also due to a brief dollar strengthening due to cheap oil and US technology exports.  

Note how GDP still reverted back to the trendline sharply thereafter.  The trendline is what matters, always..

KG,
I would expect cheap oil and techno exports to be a net increase to the GDP. Do you think that it was a deflationary pressure of the technology/atom that shows reduced growth?
And a more interesting question is do we have something like that in store for the up upcoming decade?

Fatcat,

The cheap oil strengthened the dollar briefly due to the US being the biggest oil importer by far at the time, and this is a $USD metric of GDP.  So it does see short-term fluctuation due to currency rates.

PPP removes this problem, but introduces others, so the nominal ($USD) metric is still better.  

For the upcoming decade, NGDP will continue to contract until the ATOM forces a major market correction that increases the level of central bank monetary expansion.  Since GDP is below the trendline again (even as the trendline itself is steeper than it was in 1994-2002), we will see a reversion up.  But this reversion up may require a major recession first to open the floodgates of QE..

India is the last major country to see a one-time currency gain (which China experienced 2005-12).  This will increase the US$ GDP of India from $2.5T today to $10T faster than anyone thinks (just as China covered this distance in just 7-8 years)...

Has the author of this article ever considered the existence of biophysical limits to endless economic growth? 

I am not aware of a single study, simulation or any kind of evidence demonstrating that GDP will ultimately be decoupled from energy and material use. 

This matters, a lot! It suffices to take a closer look at the Planetary Boundaries framework first introduced by Rokstrom (2009). Essentially, we have already surpassed many of the safety zones for planetary boundaries such as atmospheric carbon dioxide, biodiversity loss and anthropogenic nitrogen removed from the atmoshpere. And already, we are quickly approaching the boundaries for saturation of aragonite in surface seawater (ocean acidification) and land surface converted to crop land. 

The world, still lead by cornucopians and technology-enthusiasts, can no longer afford to ignore how earth processes and how their carrying capacity for human activities pose fundamental limits on economic growth in the medium run.

Darius,

GDP has already risen 5x per barrel of oil relative to 1974.  That process is ongoing.

Darius,

Well, one thing the ATOM does is more with less. For example, use of aluminum in cans began in 1957 - they each weighed 85 grams. By 1972 they were 21 grams per can, and 16 grams in 1992.  It is 13 grams today.  In other words, the same quantity of aluminum yields 6.5 times more cans.  More from less.

GDP cannot be decoupled from materiel use?  Seems to me the apps on my phone take increasingly little materials than the things they displace.  In fact my smart phone consolidates a dozen formerly separate devices (stereo, clock, calendar, phone, message machine, recorder, maps, TV, etc. etc.).  It takes a lot less resources than what came before, and does more, better.

In 1970 Harrison Brown, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, forecast in Scientific American that lead, zinc, tin, gold, and silver would all be gone by 1990.  Didn't happen. In fact, will never happen.  These predictions are always wrong for an important mathematical reasons that economists, and frankly anyone without advanced knowledge of geology, fails to comprehend. It's a bit complicated to explain in this format, but trust me, we are not going to ever run out of any "atoms" of anything, ever.  In fact we will have more food, metals, and energy than we know what to do with. 

"Land surface converted to crop land."  Let's just run with that since it is easy to comprehend. In the U.S., since 1948 we have tripled our productivity per acre under cultivation.  That is 300%.  Our resource input to achieve this has also declined - we are using less water, less fertilizer, and vastly less labor per unit of output to achieve this goal. Maybe we are reaching a limit?  Nope.  

No doubt you've seen the impossible burger made from plants?  How much more efficient do you imagine that to be than burgers from cows? How about 96% less land, 87% less water. 89% less GHG emissions.....  

A new company Solien intends to do even better by making proteins from air and water.  It takes just 10 liters of water and zero fertilizer to produce one kilogram of Solein, at a price comparable with the lowest soybean prices in the world. Beef requires 15,000 liters of water, and soy requires 2,500 liters of water.  Imagine producing hundreds to thousands of TIMES as much protein per unit of input than we do today.  That is more than enough to feed the world with our existing resources. Even with 10 billion, or 20 billion people. This is not some pie in the sky dream - they intend to start selling products in 2021.   

The lower 48 has 1.9 billion acres of land. Around 788 million acres, or 41.4 percent of the U.S., is grazing land.  If we fully convert to Solien, all that land could be re-wilded.  That is eight entire states worth of land the size of Montana.

Imagine >50% of the Earth’s surface being turned into a national park. That is our future.

So..yes there are boundaries.  But we are so far from them it is almost a laughable concept.  And what will keep us well below those boundaries is the ATOM. 

In fact...it took us 60 years to increase food yields 3X per unit of input.  The ATOM is promising to increase food yields by >250X (minimum) in 1/3 the time.

Excellent example.  Something most people do not even notice.

Seconded.  

<i>That is more than enough to feed the world with our existing resources. Even with 10 billion, or 20 billion people. </i>

Not just that, but fertility rates fall long before a country becomes advanced, these days.  Many countries that were at 5.0 just 30 years ago are now 2.0, so world population may already be peaking naturally.  We may not cross 9 billion people for a very long time.

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Time is the fire in which we burn.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">– Delmore Schwartz</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUTtNHw7VgU">(Video)</a></span>. &nbsp;I once had a dream in midsummer, 2015.&nbsp; I was in a dark and humid basement one afternoon, and I came across a very large book.&nbsp; Upon slapping away the dust from the cover of this grand tome, its title became visible, a title both grand and vague – <em>Exponential and Accelerating</em>.&nbsp; The mildew and centipedes aside, this was just too interesting to pass up.&nbsp; I hastily proceeded to peruse through its yellowed pages to see what was contained within; to imbibe the compilation of events from eons long past to see how we got to today.</p>
<p>The first few chapters of the book described the origin of the Earth, the evolution of early life and the progress through the geologic periods.&nbsp; The arrival of multicellular creatures, vertebrates, and advanced animals was described, but what stood out was the unstated subtext that the rate of evolutionary change was inherently accelerating, and that this accelerating gradient has been present all along, and evident at all points from 4.5 billion years ago to the present.&nbsp; It is almost as though there is an inherent recursive loop of acceleration within the genetic code of all life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: left;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e202c8d3b18e15200c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e202c8d3b18e15200c img-responsive" alt="Picture5" title="Picture5" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e202c8d3b18e15200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a>The first full 88% of the time since the origin of life on Earth represented very little advancement relative to what happened immediately thereafter, described as the '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion">Cambrian Explosion</a>' 540 million years ago.&nbsp; But it was an 'explosion' only to the extent that a linear perception would depict it as such.&nbsp; Under a logarithmic scale, it was right on schedule.&nbsp; Additionally, the rate of change was faster from that point onward; there was never a return to the pre-Cambrian slower rate of evolution.&nbsp; Even the subsequent dinosaurs of the Mesozoic era, which we think of as having lived very long ago, existed 95-98.5% of the way to the present in a linear time scale since the origin of life.&nbsp; Notice how each era becomes smaller in duration, on account of the accelerating rate of change inserting a rising level of evolution in each unit of time closer to the present.&nbsp; The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenozoic">Cenozoic era</a> is the smallest, since it is the closest to the present, yet has the greatest differential of life forms between its start to the present, with the differential itself weighted to the present.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" style="float: right;" href="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20263e94a582d200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20263e94a582d200b img-responsive" alt="Human Brain Trendline" title="Human Brain Trendline" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20264e2dc6ef0200d-pi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" width="256" height="297" /></a>Then, it became apparent that the entire description of evolution through to protohumans only occupied the first small fraction of this book, even if that was 99.9% of the elapsed time.&nbsp; The emergence of human intelligence (see illustration) occurred within an extremely brief period relative to the entire evolutionary record, almost as though intelligence was exponential.&nbsp; It took 4.5 billion years for something as intelligent as a chimpanzee to evolve, and then it took just 5 million more years for the size of the brain to triple.&nbsp; After that, the entire existence of modern humans was yet another miniscule fraction of that period.&nbsp; It seemed that the events of the last 40,000 years were more worthy of prose than the events of the preceding 4.5 billion years.</p>
<p>On to the Age of Man, I read about the earliest agriculture, the great ancient civilizations, and continued on through the Middle Ages.&nbsp; It was apparent that each century occupied more pages of the book, or rather, that each century was more filled with noteworthy events.&nbsp; The last five centuries received the most detail, and the twentieth century itself had more content than the entirety of eons prior to that point.&nbsp; I continued to read on about the Industrial Revolution, the beginnings of space exploration, and the computer age.&nbsp; The common theme was that we live in a time where events occur at an increasingly rapid rate.</p>
<p>Yet, I was only halfway through the book when I reached the present, and this puzzled me.&nbsp; I looked at the copyright date of the book and was stunned.&nbsp; The book in my dream was written in the early 22<sup>nd</sup> century, and the remaining few hundred pages were a description of the 21<sup>st</sup> century!&nbsp; I could barely contain my excitement at the prospect of reading the second half of this volume, but the pages seemed to be welded shut, and I could not turn to the pages past what described my present day.&nbsp; I tried to pry it open with a screwdriver, but to no avail.&nbsp; My dream did not allow me to see the most interesting section of this book from the future.&nbsp; I could only ponder the profound possibility that the latter 85 (now 80 as of 2020) years of the century were so eventful that it occupied half of the book; the same length as all of Earth’s noteworthy events from the start until 2015.</p>
<p>I awoke suddenly, and the next morning went straight to the bookstore to peruse some of the latest books on futurism.&nbsp; A few volumes from renowned thinkers in various fields occupied the shelves, some on the future of artificial intelligence, other books on space exploration, and still others on biotechnology.&nbsp; However, each of those books described a future saturated predominantly with only their specified technology, thereby making each book mutually exclusive with the others.&nbsp; The more holistic and multidisciplinary books were over a decade old, a situation entirely inconsistent with the accelerating rate of technological progress.&nbsp; Lastly, there was little in the way of practical applications such as policy recommendations for economic and political leaders, or guidance for ordinary people seeking to adapt to this tsunami of technological change.&nbsp; Many questions of contemporary importance were left unaddressed.</p>
<p>This vacuum convinced me that the time had come for a compact publication that weaves these rapidly accelerating but seemingly disparate strands into a single tapestry of our destiny.&nbsp; To transcend the mere theoretical, the publication must provide multiple solutions for the increasingly stifling bottleneck created by the outdated econo-political apparatus.&nbsp; For ages, the default assumptions have been built around tradeoffs between safety nets and higher taxes, or guaranteed minimum incomes and business friendliness.&nbsp; But times are changing, and we are on the brink of an era where technological diffusion will be pervasive and pronounced enough to make some of these tradeoffs recede.&nbsp; The churn of fortunes and prosperity will increasingly be governed by how much an individual, business, or government grasps the concepts of exponential, accelerating economic and technological progress.</p>
<p>There comes a rare time when a seemingly unrelated tangle of very complicated problems that continues to vex all established assumptions can be addressed with a comprehensive, elegant, yet simple solution.&nbsp; If ever there was a time and place for ‘outside the box’ ideas of grand scope, it is here and now.&nbsp; As a society, we could be on the brink of taking prosperity to a new level with some remarkably straightforward economic and monetary adaptations.&nbsp; But if we do not embark on these reforms, we will soon have another financial crisis within the next few years, which may be worse than the previous one.</p>
<p>To describe the multiple interlocking forces between technology, economics, finance, and government in as simple and concise a manner as possible, I have embedded brief introductory videos at the start of major chapters.&nbsp; This layer is for the benefit of those who would like a summary of a particular topic in the publication before they decide to read a formidable wall of text.&nbsp; The goal of this publication is to reach a large and diverse audience of people on some very complicated subject matter, among whom learning speeds and styles can vary greatly.</p>
<p>What you are about to read and watch might change the way you look at the world, and fully change every assumption you have about the future, mostly for the better.&nbsp; At a minimum, you might never look at certain slices of life the same way again.</p>
<p>To begin, let us first consider the many complicated trends, policies, and interconnections that govern the world today.&nbsp; Perhaps you are worried about technology replacing your job or the jobs of people close to you.&nbsp; Perhaps you feel that your taxes are too high, and that government spending patterns do not reflect your values.&nbsp; Perhaps you are troubled as to why interest rates are nearly zero, yet there seems to be deflation spreading across many sectors of the economy.&nbsp; Perhaps you just feel that technology is creating a new type of inequality that is hard to describe by old-fashioned criteria, yet palpable on an instinctual level.</p>
<p>If you feel any or all of the above questions are a source of personal uncertainty, then this is the reading material for you.&nbsp; You may start thinking about many important topics that have very little written about them.&nbsp; Even better, perhaps you can get behind some of the ideas I have presented here, since many of these challenges can be addressed in highly complementary ways.&nbsp; As we embark on this unpacking process, we must divide the body of knowledge into sections.&nbsp; There are multiple concepts that tie together to form the grand unified set of analyses and recommendations I am presenting here.</p>
<p>To begin, we will first establish the case that economic growth is and always has been exponential and accelerating, and has been throughout all of human civilization, even as it is being partly stifled at present.&nbsp; Secondly, we will examine the deepening scope of technological penetration into an ever-widening share of the economy, how this is creating accelerating deflation, and why this is not necessarily a negative thing.&nbsp; After that, we will arrive at a policy solution for governments and central banks to assess and implement, designed to remove the drag effect of the current set of policies and set the stage for the next era of economic ascendance.&nbsp; Finally, we will detail some case studies and ideas that you can benefit from on a personal level, and claim a greater slice of the Third Millennium Economy, since, after all, some others already are.</p>

Implicit in the description of your 2015 dream is the concept that the Age of Man is compressing the rate of progress while simultaneously increasing the length, breath and depth of the progress.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Executive Summary</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #007f40;">The accelerating pace and diffusion of technological change has taken control of an ever-growing fraction of the world economy.&#0160; This fraction is being assimilated into a different set of economic fundamentals, such as the rapid and exponential price deflation inherent to technology.&#0160; The effect of this was insignificant until recently, but is now beginning to create conspicuous distortions in many economic metrics, and is just years from being the dominant force across the entire economy.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #007f40;">In response to technological deflation, the central banks of the world will have to create new money in perpetuity, increasing the stream at an exponentially rising rate much higher than is currently assumed.&#0160; This now-permanent need for monetary expansion, if embraced, can fund government spending more directly.&#0160; This in turn creates a very robust, dynamic, and efficient safety net for citizens, while simultaneously reducing and even eliminating most forms of taxation by 2025-30.&#0160; Alternatively, this monetary expansion can be a means to create Sovereign Venture Funds that can hedge a country&#39;s risk far more effectively than existing sovereign wealth funds.&#0160;&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #007f40;">Failure to recognize that technological deflation mandates permanent and ever-rising central bank monetary expansion that can and should gradually become the primary source of government spending could result in countries falling behind more enlightened countries in a very short time.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #007f40;">The nature of current worldwide technology is to link various disruptions with each other, consume monetary liquidity to generate deflation, and lower the effective prices of most goods and services over time.&#0160; Therefore, the entirety of worldwide technology has to be seen as a holistic economic entity, and can be defined as an ‘Accelerating TechnOnomic Medium’, or ‘ATOM’, which itself is the central concept of &#39;Third Millennium Economics&#39;.&#0160;&#0160;</span></p>

Thanks, Al.

The comments section here is going to be the early discussion forum, but for that we need more traffic.  This is still the early stage, so I am just seeking to get more people (and more of the right people) to read it.  Anything you can do to build exposure/readership gets us closer to our goal...

Very interesting and laudable. One thing, however: THIS: "Accelerating TechnOnomic Medium" -- is too obscure and confusing. You must find a better way of expressing what is surely a very important idea. IMO.

Alan2102,

Thanks for reading the whole thing.  I thought about it at great length, but there did not appear to be a more acronym-friendly name that works well in the logo and conveys what the whole concept is about.  So we went with 'ATOM'.

I have briefly read through this and I'm hoping to find the time to thoroughly read and analyze it. I think it is revolutionary thinking and I wish people were talking about this. I have discussed and shared this article with a few people, but I plan to spread the message as much as I can!

<p><span style="font-family: &#39;trebuchet ms&#39;, geneva; font-size: 10pt;">CNET had <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-20017972-54.html">an article just last month&#0160;about the multiple disruptions that the various allotopes of carbon are about to make</a>.&#0160; That is quite exciting, except that <a href="http://news.cnet.com/The-stuff-of-dreams/2009-1008_3-5091267.html">CNET also had a similar article in 2003</a>.&#0160; Similarly, Ray Kurzweil&#0160;extolled carbon nanotubes as a successor to silicon quite&#0160;heavily in 1999, but not quite as much now, even though that supposed transition would be much closer to the present.&#0160; This does not mean that Kurzweil&#39;s estimation was in error, but rather that the technology was unexpectedly stagnant during the early 2000s.&#0160;&#0160;So let us examine why there was such an interruption, and whether progress has since resumed.&#0160; &#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;trebuchet ms&#39;, geneva; font-size: 10pt;"><a href="http://www.techsectorweb.com/2009/03/nanotechnology-bubble-bustboom.html" style="float: right;" target="_self"><img alt="Graphene" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20133f57c20f1970b" height="221" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20133f57c20f1970b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Graphene" width="296" /></a></span><br /><span style="font-family: &#39;trebuchet ms&#39;, geneva; font-size: 10pt;"> I wrote <a href="http://www.techsectorweb.com/2009/03/nanotechnology-bubble-bustboom.html" target="_self">in 2009 about how we had undergone a multi-year nanotech winter, and how we were emerging from it in 2009</a>.&#0160; As anticipated, carbon nanotubes are now finally lowering in price, and being produced at a scale that could start making an impact.&#0160; Sure enough, activity began to stir right as I predicted, and t<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/26469/?p1=A4&amp;a=f">he 2010 Nobel Prize in physics has been awarded to research in graphene</a>.&#0160; Just like CNETs article, <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/10/graphene/" target="_self">Wired also has an article about the diverse applications that graphene could revolutionize</a>.&#0160; Combining the two articles, we can summarize&#0160;the core&#0160;possibilities of carbon allotopes as follows&#0160;:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;trebuchet ms&#39;, geneva; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Ultra-dense computing and storage </strong>: Graphene transistors smaller than 1 nanometer have been demonstrated.&#0160; Carbon allotopes could keep the exponential doubling of both computing and storage&#0160;capacity going well into the 2030s.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;trebuchet ms&#39;, geneva; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Carbon Fiber Vehicles </strong>: This lightweight, ultrastrong material can save vast amounts of fuel by reducing the weight of cars and aeroplanes.&#0160; While premium products such as the $6000 Trek Madone bicycles are already made from carbon fiber, greater volume is reducing prices and will soon make the average car much ligher than it is today, increasing fuel efficiency and reducing traffic fatalities.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;trebuchet ms&#39;, geneva; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Energy Storage :</strong> Natural Gas is not only much cheaper than oil per unit of energy (oil would have to drop to about $30 to match current NG prices), but the supply of NG is more evenly distributed across the world than the oil supply.&#0160; The US alone has an enormous reserve of natural gas that could ensure total energy independence.&#0160; The main problem with NG is storage, which is the primary reason oil displacement is not happening rapidly.&#0160; But microporous carbon can effectively act as a sponge for natural gas, enabling safe and easy transport.&#0160; This could potentially change the entire energy map.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;trebuchet ms&#39;, geneva; font-size: 10pt;">There are other applications beyond these core three, but suffice it to say, the allotopes of carbon can perform a greater variety of functions than any other material available to us today.&#0160; Watch for indications of carbon allotopes popping up in the strangest of places, and know that each emergence drives the cost down ever lower.&#0160;</span></p>

<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">After years of thinking about this, I have come up with a term that can describe the thoughts I have had about the new, 'good' type of deflation that is evading the notice of almost all of the top economists in the world today.&nbsp; This changes many of the most fundamental assumptions about economics, even as most economic thought is far behind the curve.&nbsp; </P>
<P>First, let us review some events that transpired over the last 2 years.&nbsp; To stave off the prospect of a deflationary spiral that could lead to a depression, the major governments of the world followed 20th-century textbook economics, and injected colossal amounts of liquidity into the financial system.&nbsp; In the US, not only was the Fed Funds rate lowered to nearly zero (for now 18 months and counting), but an additional $1 Trillion was injected in.&nbsp; </P>
<P>However, now that a depression has been averted, and the recession has ended, we were supposed to experience inflation even amidst high unemployment, just like we did in the 1970s, to minimize debt burdens.&nbsp; But alas, there is still no inflation, despite a yield curve with more than 3% steepness, and a near-0% FF rate for so long.&nbsp; How could this be?&nbsp; What is absorbing all the liquidity?&nbsp; &nbsp; </P>
<P>In&nbsp;<A href="http://www.techsectorweb.com/2009/04/the-impact-of-computing-78-more-each-year.html#tp">The Impact of Computing</A>, I discussed how 1.5% of World GDP today comprises of products where the same functionality can be purchased for a price that halves every 18 months.&nbsp; 'Moore's Law' applies to semiconductors, but storage, software, and some biotech are also on a similar exponential curve.&nbsp; This force makes productivity gains higher, and inflation lower, than traditional 20th century economics would anticipate.&nbsp; Furthermore, the second derivative is also increasing - the rate of productivity gains itself is accelerating.&nbsp;&nbsp;1.5% of World GDP may be small, but what about when this percentage grows to 3% of World GDP?&nbsp; 5%?&nbsp; We may only be a decade away from this, and the impact of this technological deflation will be more obvious.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Most high-tech companies have a business model that incorporates a sort of 'bizarro force' that is completely the opposite of what old-economy companies operate under :&nbsp;<em>The price of the products sold by a high-tech company decreases over time</em>.&nbsp; Any other company will manage inventory, pricing, and forecasts under an assumption of inflationary price increases, but a technology company exists under the reality that all inventory depreciates very quickly (at over 10% per quarter in many cases), and that price drops will shrink revenues unless unit sales rise enough to offset it (and assuming that enough unit inventory was even produced).&nbsp; This results in the constant pressure to create new and improved products every few months just to occupy prime price points, without which revenues would plunge within just a year.&nbsp; Yet, high-tech companies have built hugely profitable businesses around these peculiar challenges, and at least&nbsp;8 such US companies have market capitalizations over $100 Billion.&nbsp; 6 of those 8 are headquartered in Silicon Valley.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Now, here is the point to ponder : We have never had a significant technology sector while also facing the&nbsp;fears (warranted or otherwise)&nbsp;of high inflation.&nbsp; When high inflation vanished in 1982, the technology sector was too tiny to be considered a significant contributor to macroeconomic statistics.&nbsp; In an environment of high inflation combined with a large technology industry, however, major consumer retail pricepoints, such as $99.99 or $199.99, become more affordable.&nbsp; The same also applies to enterprise-class customers.&nbsp; Thus, demand creeps upwards even as cost to produce the products goes down on the same Impact of Computing curve.&nbsp; <em>This allows a technology company the ability to postpone price drops and expand margins, or to sell more volume at the same nominal dollar price.&nbsp; </em>Hence, higher inflation causes the revenues and/or margins of technology companies to rise, which means their earnings-per-share certainly surges.</P>
<P>So what we are seeing is the gigantic amount of liquidity created by the Federal Reserve is instead cycling through technology companies and increasing their earnings.&nbsp; <em>The products they sell, in turn, increase productivity and promptly push inflation back down.</em>&nbsp; Every uptick in inflation merely guarantees its own pushback, and the 1.5% of GDP that mops up all the liquidity and creates this form of 'good' deflation can be termed as the 'Techno-Sponge'.&nbsp; So how much liquidity can&nbsp;the Techno-Sponge&nbsp;absorb before saturation?&nbsp; </P>
<P>At this point, if the US prints another $1 Trillion, that will still merely halt deflation, and there will be no hint of inflation at all.&nbsp; It would take a full&nbsp;$2 Trillion to saturate the techno-sponge, and temporarily push consumer inflation to even the less-than-terrifying level of 4% while also generating substantial jumps in productivity and tech company earnings.&nbsp; In fact, the demographics of the US, with baby boomers reaching their geriatric years, are highly deflationary (and this is the bad type of deflation), so the US would have to print another $1 Trillion every year for the next 10 years just to offset demographic deflation, and keep the techno-sponge saturated.&nbsp; </P>
<P>A techno-sponge that is 1.5% of GDP might be keeping CPI inflation at under 2%, but when the techno-sponge is 3% of GDP, even trillions of dollars of liquidity won't halt deflation.&nbsp; Deflation may become normal, even as living standards and productivity rise at ever-increasing rates.&nbsp; The people who will suffer are holders of debt, particularly mortgage debt.&nbsp; Inflating away debt will no longer be a tool available to rescue people (and governments) from their errors.&nbsp; The biggest beneficiaries will be technology companies, and those who are tied to them.&nbsp; </P>
<P>But to keep prosperity rising, productivity has to rise at the maximum possible rate.&nbsp; This requires the Techno-Sponge to be kept full at all times - the 'new normal'.&nbsp; Thus, the printing press has to start on the first $1 Trillion now, and printing has to continue <em>until</em> we see inflation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Economists will be surprised at how much can be printed without seeing any inflation, and will not be able to draw the connection about why the printed money is boosting productivity.&nbsp; </P>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Words like &#39;disruption&#39; and &#39;destruction&#39; usually have negative meanings, and one may strain to find any good ways in which to use the terms.&#0160; But today, the <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2006/12/are_you_acceler.html">accelerating rate of change</a> ensures that more technologies alter more aspects of life at an ever-quickening rate.&#0160; A little-understood dimension of this is the concept of Joseph Schumpeter&#39;s &#39;Creative Destruction&#39;, where the process of technological change topples existing norms, often quite rapidly.&#0160; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><a href="http://www.techsectorweb.com/2008/02/is-technology-d.html">Technological diffusion was in a lull in 2008, as I pointed out at the time</a>.&#0160; But now, in 2010, I am happy to report that the recess has passed, and that the accelerating rate of change is rising back to the long-term exponential trendline (although it may not be fully back at the trendline until 2013, when people who have not been paying attention will be wondering why they were taken by surprise).&#0160; The <a href="http://www.techsectorweb.com/2009/04/the-impact-of-computing-78-more-each-year.html">Impact of Computing</a> continues to progress, infusing itself into a wider and wider swath of our lives, and speeding up the rate of change in complacently stagnant industries that never thought technology could affect them.&#0160; Silicon Valley continues to be &#39;ground zero&#39; for creative destruction, and complacent industries thousands of miles away could be toppled by someone working from their bedroom in Silicon Valley.&#0160;</span></p>
<p>Just a few of the examples of creative destruction that is presently in process have been covered by prior articles here at Techsector.&#0160; These, along with others, are :</p>
<p>1)&#0160;Video Conferencing&#0160;is poised to disrupt not just airline and hotel industry revenues (which stand to lose tens of billions of dollars per year of business travel revenue), but the real-estate, medical, and&#0160;aeronautical industries as well.&#0160; Corporations will see substantial productivity gains from successful adoption of videoconferencing as a substitute for 50% or more of their travel expenses.&#0160; Major mergers and acquisitions have happened in this sector in the last few months, and imminent price reductions will open the floodgates of diffusion.&#0160; Skype provides a form of video telephony that is free of cost.&#0160; <a href="http://www.techsectorweb.com/2009/08/video-conferencing-a-cascade-of-disruptions.html">This is described in detail in my August 2008 article on the subject</a>, as well as in my earlier <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2006/10/ciscos_hd_video.html">October 2006 introductory article</a>.&#0160;</p>
<p>2) Surface Computing, <a href="http://www.techsectorweb.com/2008/07/surface-interfaces-the-next-killer-ap-in-computing.html">which I wrote about in July of 2008</a>, has begun to emerge in a myriad of forms, from the handheld Apple iPad to the upcoming consumer version of the table-sized Microsoft Surface.&#0160; This not only transforms human-computer interaction for the first time in&#0160;decades, but the Apple &#39;Apps&#39; ecosystem&#0160;alters the utility of the Internet as well.&#0160; All sizes between the blackboard and the iPad will soon be available, and by 2015, personal computing, and the Internet, will be quite different than they are today, with surfaces of varying sizes abundant in many homes.&#0160;</p>
<p>3)&#0160;The complete and total transformation of video games into the dominant form of home entertainment will be visible by 2012 through a combination of technologies such as realistic graphics, motion-responsive controllers, 3-D televisions, voice recognition, etc.&#0160; The biggest casualty of this disruption will be television programming, which will struggle to retain viewers.&#0160; Beyond this, the way in which humans process sensations of pleasure, excitement, and entertainment will irrevocably change.&#0160; Thus, the way humans relate to each other will also change.&#0160; <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2006/04/the_next_big_th.html">I have written about this in April 2006</a>, with <a href="http://www.techsectorweb.com/2009/07/the-next-big-thing-in-entertainment-a-halftime-update.html">a follow-up in July 2009</a>.&#0160;</p>
<p>4) The book-publishing industry has been stubbornly resistant to technology, as evidenced by their insistence as late as 2003 that manuscript queries be submitted by postal mail, and that a self-addressed stamped envelope&#0160;be enclosed in which a reply can be sent.&#0160; A completed manuscript would take a full 12 months to be printed and distributed, and the editors didn&#39;t even find this to be odd.&#0160; Fortunately, two simultaneous disruptions are toppling this obsolete and unproductive industry from both ends.&#0160; Print-on-demand services that greatly shorten the self-publishing process and entry-cost, such as iUniverse and Blurb, are now flexible and easy, while finished books can further avoid the paper-binding process altogether and be available to millions in e-book format for the Kindle and other e-readers.&#0160; When&#0160;e-readers&#0160;are eventually available for only $100, bookstores that sell paper books will be relegated to surviving mostly on gifts, coffee table books, and cafe revenues.&#0160; This is a disruption that is happening quickly due to it being so overdue in the first place, resulting in a speedy &#39;catchup&#39;.&#0160; <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2009/12/the-publishing-disruption.html">I wrote about this in more detail in December of 2009</a>.</p>
<p>5)&#0160;<a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2007/05/a_future_timeli.html">The automobile is undergoing multiple major transformations at once</a>.&#0160; Strong, light nanomaterials are entering the bodies of&#0160;cars to increase fuel efficiency, engines are migrating to hybrid and electrical forms, sub-$5000 cars in India and China will lead to innovations that percolate up to lower the cost of traditional Western models, and the computational power engineered into the average car today&#0160;leads to major feature jumps&#0160;relative to models from just 5 years ago.&#0160; The $25,000 car of 2020 will be superior to the $50,000 car of 2005 is every measurable way.&#0160;</p>
<p>By 2016, consumer behavior will change to a mode where people consider it normal to &#39;upgrade&#39; their perfectly functioning 6-year-old cars to get a newer model with better electronic features.&#0160;&#0160;This may seem odd, but people did not&#0160;tend to replace&#0160;fully functional television sets before they failed until the 2003 thin-TV disruption.&#0160; The Impact of Computing pulls ever-more products into a rapid trajectory of improvement.&#0160;</p>
<p>By 2018, self-driving cars will be readily available to the average US consumer, and will constitute a significant fraction of cars on the highway.&#0160; This will&#0160;revise existing assumptions about&#0160;highway speeds and acceptable commute distances, and will further impede the real estate prices of expensive areas.&#0160;</p>
<p>6) The Mobile Internet revolution, <a href="http://www.techsectorweb.com/2009/10/mobile-broadband-a-prediction-follow-up.html">which I wrote about in October of 2009</a>,&#0160;is already transforming the way consumers in developed markets access the Internet.&#0160; The bigger disruption is the entry of 1 billion new Internet users from emerging economies.&#0160; While many of these&#0160;people have relatively little education compared to Western Internet users, as the West&#0160;shrinks as a fraction of total Internet mindshare, many Western&#0160;cultural quirks that are seen as normal (such as institutionalized misandry sustained by an ever-expanding state) might be seen for the&#0160;aberrations that they are.&#0160; Thomas Friedman&#39;s concept of the world being &#39;flat&#39; has not even begun to fully manifest.&#0160;</p>
<p>7) <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2007/02/a_future_timeli.html">The energy sector is in the midst of multiple disruptions</a>, which will introduce competition between sectors that were previously unrelated.&#0160; Electrical vehicles displace oil consumption with electricity, even while the electricity itself starts to be generated through nuclear, <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2009/02/solar-powers-next-5-gamechanging-technologies.html">solar</a>, and wind.&#0160; The electrical economy will be further transformed by revolutions in <a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/09/the_imminent_re.html">lighting</a> and <a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/03/the-future-of-b.html">batteries</a>.&#0160; Cellulostic ethanol will arrive in 2012, and further replace billions of gallons of&#0160;gasoline.&#0160; <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2007/10/why-i-want-oil-.html">I wrote in October 2007 why I want oil to surpass $120/barrel and stay there</a> (it subsequently was above that level for a mere 6-week period in 2008).&#0160; This leads to why <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2008/03/rebuttal-to-a-f.html">I claim that &#39;Peak Oil&#39;, far from being fatal for civilization, will actually be a topic few people even mention in 2020</a>.&#0160; The creative destruction in energy will extend to the geopolitical landscape, where we will see many petrotyrannies much weaker in 2020 than they are today.&#0160;</p>
<p>8) Despite the efforts of Democrats to create a system unfavorable to&#0160;advancement in healthcare and biotechnology, <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2008/05/ten-biotechnolo.html">innovation continues on several fronts</a> (partly due to Asian nations compensating for US shortfalls).&#0160; One disruption is robotic surgery, where incisions can be narrow&#0160;instead of the customary practice of making incisions large enough for the surgeon&#39;s hands, which in turn often necessitates sawing open the sternum, pelvis, etc.&#0160; Intuitive Surgical is a company that already has a market cap of $14 Billion.&#0160;</p>
<p>The biggest disruption, however, is that the globalization of technology is enabling <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2008/08/more-on-the-economics-of-medical-tourism.html">medical tourism</a>.&#0160;&#0160;In the US, about twice as much is spent on healthcare as in other OECD countries.&#0160; If manufacturing and software work can be offshored, so can many aspects of healthcare, which is much more expensive than manufacturing or software engineering ever became in the US.&#0160; This will correct inflated salaries in the healthcare sector, return the savings to consumers, and force innovations and systemic improvements in all OECD countries.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20133f1a4c7e1970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Genome" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20133f1a4c7e1970b " src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20133f1a4c7e1970b-800wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Genome" /></a> 9) By all accounts, the cost of genome sequencing has plunged by a factor of 10,000 in just the last 4 years (it is less clear how this was accomplished, and whether the next 4 years will see a comparable drop).&#0160; I tend to be skeptical about such eye-popping numbers, because if something became so much cheaper so quickly, yet it still didn&#39;t sweep over the world, then maybe it was not so valuable after all.&#0160;</p>
<p>But it is also possible that while the raw data is now available cheaply, there is not yet enough of a community that instructs people how to use their data.&#0160; As more people sequence their genomes, networks of common genetic patterns will form, and health information will be shared.&#0160; Medicine will take on a Web 2.0 flavor, and physicians that realize they need to practice medicine as an information technology will thrive, while those who still adhere to the paternalistic paradigm will be left behind.&#0160; The standard medical diagnosis will be for a user to ask questions to others with the same genotype, and receive answers from multiple laypeople, and then, if necessary, take the information to a genome-savvy doctor.&#0160; <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/16349358?story_id=16349358">The Economist has a special report on the implications of inexpensive genome sequencing.</a>&#0160;</p>
<p>10) Social media such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. are mostly inundated with the trivialities of young people, or of older people who never matured, who think they have an audience far larger than it is.&#0160; However, these mediums have been used to horizontally organize interest groups and movements for political change that know no distance barriers or boundaries.&#0160;</p>
<p>Blogs have shattered the hold that traditional media had on the release of information and opinions, and the revenues of newspapers, magazines, and network television have tumbled.&#0160; The Tea Party movement in the US was started by a very small number of people, but&#0160;has surged with a momentum that has reshaped the American landscape in just one year, and, irony of ironies, the Tea Party is spreading to overtaxed Britain.&#0160; The next Iranian revolution will not only use Twitter and YouTube, but will have millions of collaborators outside of Iran, operating out of their own homes.&#0160;</p>
<p>11) The financial services industry currently charges $100 Billion in fees for the $3.3 Trillion in annual credit/debit card transactions that take place in the US alone.&#0160; <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/18-03">This was the cover story of Wired Magazine for March 2010</a>, and was a structure established in an era when computing power needed to process transactions was expensive.&#0160; Today, several startups are seeking to change the way money is transacted to eliminate this cut that incumbent companies take.&#0160; Major financial services companies will see shrinkages in revenue, and will have to innovate and create new value-added services, or accept a diminishment.&#0160;</p>
<p>Aside from this effectively being a sizable &#39;tax cut&#39; for the economy, this is particularly valuable as a complement to mobile Internet penetration in poorer regions, as the capacity to conduct web micro-transactions without fees will be an essential element of human development.&#0160; The highly successful concept of micro-finance will be augmented when transaction fees that consumed a high percentage of these sub-$10 transactions are minimized.&#0160;</p>
<p>12) 3-D Printing will soon be&#0160;accessible to small businesses and households.&#0160; This transforms everything from commodity consumer goods to the construction of buildings.&#0160; An individual could download a design and print it at home, rather than be restricted to only those products that can be mass produced.&#0160; <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2008/09/can-buildings-be-printed.html">It is quite possible that by 2025, construction of basic structures takes less than one-tenth the time that it does today</a>, which, of course, will deflate the value of all existing buildings in the world at that time.&#0160;</p>
<p>So we see&#0160;there are at least&#0160;12 ways in which our daily lives will shift considerably&#0160;in just&#0160;the next few years.&#0160; The typical process of creative destruction results in X wealth being destroyed, and 2X wealth being created instead, but by different people.&#0160; For each of the 12 disruptions listed, &#39;X&#39; might be as much a $1 Trillion.&#0160; As a result, the US economy might be mired in a&#0160;long-term situation where vanishing industries force many&#0160;laid off workers&#0160;to start in new industries&#0160;at the entry level,&#0160;for half of their previous compensation, even as new fortunes created by the new industries cause net wealth increases.&#0160; The US could see a continuation of high unemployment combined with high productivity gains and corporate earnings growth for several years to come.&#0160;&#0160;This would be the &#39;new normal&#39;.&#0160;</p>
<p>Income diversification is the golden rule of the early 21st&#0160;century.&#0160; Those that fail to create and maintain multiple streams of income are imperiling themselves.&#0160; The hottest career one can embark on, which will never be obsolete,&#0160;is that of the serial entrepreneur.&#0160;</p>

<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">What a unique thing a book is.&nbsp; Made from a tree, it has a hundred or more flexible pages that contain written text, enabling the book to contain a large sum of information in a very small volume.&nbsp; Before paper, clay tablets, sheepskin parchment, and papyrus were all used to store information with far less efficiency.&nbsp; Paper itself was once so rare and valuable that the Emperor of China had guards stationed around his paper posessions.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Before the invention of the printing press, books were written by hand, and few outside of monastaries knew how to read.&nbsp; There were only a few thousand books in all of Europe in the 14th century.&nbsp; Charlemagne himself took great effort to learn how to read, but never managed to learn how to write, which still put him ahead of most kings of the time, who were generally illiterate.&nbsp; </P>
<P>But with the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century, it became possible to make multiple copies of the same book, and before long, the number of books in Europe increased from thousands to millions.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Fast forward to the early 21st century, and books are still printed by the millions.&nbsp; Longtime readers of&nbsp;Techsector know that I initially had written a book (2001-02), and sought to have it published the old-fashioned way.&nbsp; However, the publishing industry, and literary agents, were astonishingly low-tech.&nbsp; They did not use email, and required queries to be submitted via regular mail, with a self-addressed, stamped envelope included.&nbsp; So I had to pay postage in both directions, and wait several days for a round trip to hear their response.&nbsp; And this was just the literary agents.&nbsp; The actual publishing house, if they decide to accept your book, would still take 12 months to produce and distribute the book even after the manuscript was complete.&nbsp; Even then, royalties would be 10-15% of the retail price.&nbsp; This prospect did not seem compelling to me, and I chose to parse my book into this blog you see before&nbsp;you.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The refusal by the publishing industry to use email and other productivity-enhancing technologies as recently as 2003 kept their wages low.&nbsp; Editors always moaned that they worked 60 hours a week just to make $50,000 a year, the same as they made in 1970.&nbsp; My answer to them is that they have no basis to expect wage increases without increasing their productivity through technology.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In the meantime, self-publishing technologies emerged to bypass the traditional publishers' role as arbitrers of what can become a book and what cannot.&nbsp; From Lulu to iUniverse to BookSmart, any individual can produce a book, with copies that can be printed on demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instances where an individual is seeking to go it alone without being saddled with a huge upfront inventory production and storage burden, or is otherwise marketing to only a tiny audience, have flourished.&nbsp; But print-on-demand is not the true disruption - that was yet to come.&nbsp; </P>
<P><A class=image href="http://www.typepad.com/wiki/File:Kindle_2_-_Front.jpg"></A><A style="FLOAT: right" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20120a74a54cc970b-pi"><img  class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20120a74a54cc970b " title=Kindle style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px" alt=Kindle src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20120a74a54cc970b-800wi" border=0 /></A> The Amazon Kindle launched in late 2007 at the high price of $400.&nbsp; Within 2 years, <A href="http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/tq/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15048695">a substantially more advanced Kindle 2 was available for a much lower price of&nbsp;$260, alongside competing readers from several other companies</A>.&nbsp; Many&nbsp;people feel that the appeal of holding a physical book in our hands cannot be replaced by a display screen, and take a cavalier attitude towards dismissing e-readers.&nbsp; The tune changes upon learning that the price of a book on an e-reader is just a third of what the paper form at a brick-and-mortar bookstore, with sales tax, would cost.&nbsp; Market research firm iSuppli estimates that 5 million readers have been sold in 2009, and another 12 million will sell in 2010.&nbsp; Amazon estimates that over one-third of its book sales are now through the kindle, greatly displacing sales of paper books.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Imagine what happens when the Kindle and other e-readers cost only $100.&nbsp; Brick and mortar bookstores will consolidate to fewer premises, extract profits mainly from picture-heavy books and magazines, and&nbsp;step up their positioning&nbsp;as&nbsp;literary coffeehouses.&nbsp; Many employees and affiliates of the publishing industry will see their functions eliminated as part of the productivity gains.&nbsp; College students forced to pay $100 for a textbook produced in small quantities will now pay only $20 for an e-reader version.&nbsp; But even this is not the ultimate endgame of disruption.&nbsp; </P>
<P><A style="FLOAT: right" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20120a74a56b3970b-pi"><img  class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20120a74a56b3970b " title="Intel Reader" style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px; WIDTH: 286px; HEIGHT: 349px" height=375 alt="Intel Reader" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20120a74a56b3970b-800wi" width=286 border=0 /></A> <A style="FLOAT: right" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20120a74a562d970b-pi"></A><A href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_50/b4159080740036.htm?chan=technology_tech+maven+page+-+new_digital+entertainment">Intel now has a reader for the visually impaired that scans text from paper books, and reads them in an acceptable audio voice</A>.&nbsp; It is reported that with practice, an audio rate of 250 words per minute can be coherent.&nbsp; While the reader costs $1500, and requires a user to turn pages manually, it is a matter of time before not only the reader's price drops,&nbsp;and more and more books are available as text files similar to those&nbsp;contained in&nbsp;e-readers like the Kindle.&nbsp; There are already books available as free downloads of text files under the ironically named Project Gutenberg.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Therein lies the crescendo of disruption.&nbsp; The Intel Reader is a $1500 device for the visually impaired, but will soon evolve into a technology that interfaces with Kindle-type e-readers and chatters off e-books at 250 words/minute, from the full e-book library that is vastly larger than any traditional collection of audiobooks.&nbsp; A 90,000-word novel could be recited in&nbsp;just 6&nbsp;hours, enabling a user to imbibe the whole&nbsp;book during a single coast-to-coast flight, even if the lights are dimmed.&nbsp; People could&nbsp;further choose to preserve their vision at home, devouring book after book with the lights out.&nbsp; As the technology advances further, the speech technology will allow the user to select a voice of his choosing to be read to in, perhaps even his own voice.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Thus, without many people even noticing the murmurs, we can&nbsp;predict that the next&nbsp;3 years will see the biggest&nbsp;transformation in book production and consumption since the days of Johannes Gutenberg.&nbsp; That is a true demonstration of both the <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2006/12/are_you_acceler.html">Accelerating Rate of Change</A> and <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2009/04/the-impact-of-computing-78-more-per-year-v20.html">The Impact of Computing</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">Many of you may be familiar with this sectoral strategy that I have presented, which was due to the unusually wide&nbsp;extreme to which these two sectors had diverged from each other as of April 22, 2008. To review :</P>
<P><A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2008/04/energy-vs-finan.html">On April 22, 2008, I decided to go short on Energy (XLE) and long on Financials (XLF).</A></P>
<P><A href="http://www.techsectorweb.com/2009/05/energy-vs-financials-results.html">Then, on May 20, 2009, I decided to cover the Energy short, and use the proceeds to double down on Financials.&nbsp; Up till that point, the trade had earned a loss of -5.36%, vs. a loss of -32.20% for the S&P500</A>.</P>
<P>Now, it is time to sell the Financials position, and assess the final performance over the entire 18-month period, against the S&P 500.</P>
<P><A style="DISPLAY: inline" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20120a685ea19970b-pi"><img  class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20120a685ea19970b image-full " title=Enerfin alt=Enerfin src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20120a685ea19970b-800wi" border=0 /></A> </P>
<P>The purple line indicates the May 20, 2009 transition from being short&nbsp;XLE to covering that short and using the full proceeds to double down on XLF.&nbsp; Note that the short of XLE was profitable, so that the amount that was redeployed to XLF was more than the existing value of the XLF position.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Therefore, the final results are (with all dividends reinvested) :</P>
<P><A style="DISPLAY: inline" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201287587db01970c-popup"><img  class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e201287587db01970c " title=Enerfin2 alt=Enerfin2 src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201287587db01970c-800wi" border=0 /></A>&nbsp;<br>This strategy yielded a&nbsp;gain of <span style="COLOR: #007f40; FONT-FAMILY: ">21.92%</span> vs. a loss of <span style="COLOR: #ff4040; FONT-FAMILY: ">-17.19%</span> for the S&P500.&nbsp; This is a huge gap of almost 40 points, and means that $10,000 deployed to this strategy would have yielded $12,192, vs. just $8,281 if placed in the S&P500 over this period.&nbsp; Also note how the gap widened from what it was on May 20, 2009.&nbsp; </P>
<P>This continues <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2009/01/the-futurists-stock-portfolio-for-2008-results.html">our track record here at&nbsp;TechSector of&nbsp;collectively beating the market by a wide margin</A>, with portfolios that beat the market greatly exceeding the deficit of those that do not.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, these trades are for entertainment purposes only, and should not be taken as professional advice.&nbsp; </P>

<p>The SmartGrid is the third major area of growth for the networking industry in the next decade, the other two being the previously discussed <a href="http://www.techsectorweb.com/2009/08/video-conferencing-a-cascade-of-disruptions.html">Telepresence</a> and <a href="http://www.techsectorweb.com/2009/10/mobile-broadband-a-prediction-follow-up.html">Mobile Internet</a> subsectors.&#0160; Like the other two sectors, the SmartGrid will disrupt many existing industries and infrastructures that have been undisturbed for several decades.&#0160; </p>
<p>Most of the world operates on an analog power grid built in the 19th and 20th centuries.&#0160; In the early 21st century, the advances in information technology can enable a comprehensive revamp of the existing electrical infrastructure.&#0160;&#0160;A slew of products are about to be released and deployed into the market that&#0160;can increase electricity supply by 20% or more, match revenue and costs more closely, reduce capital expenditures on generators and transmission lines/poles, and manage the demand differences between mid-day and night.&#0160; </p>
<p>Factors that will greatly change the daily cycle of electricity demand are solar&#0160;power being sent into the grid during the daytime, while millions of expected plug-in hybrid and fully-electric vehicles will be withdrawing power overnight.&#0160; The two key areas of growth are smart meter installation, and tranmission infrastructure upgrades.&#0160; </p>
<p>A few fast facts :</p>
<p>1) $20B in government injections will be devoted to SmartGrid upgrades from 2009-2014, including over $4.5B in the US.</p>
<p>2) A full upgrade will cost $200-$300 per endpoint.&#0160; </p>
<p>3) Companies that stand to benefit over the next 5 years include ESCO Technologies (ESCO), Itron (ITRI), Comverge (COMV), Silver Springs Networks, and eMeter.&#0160; </p>
<p>4) All backbone networking technologies like Powerline, WiMax, and fiber optics will benefit from the large amount of two-way data between the home and the utility.&#0160; </p>
<p>The arrival of the technology to form an entire SmartGrid ecosystem is timely for emerging countries, most notably India and China, in which many villages were not wired for electricity at all (40% of India&#39;s population still does not have electricity).&#0160; They can leapfrog directly to the SmartGrid, even for people receiving electricity for the first time.&#0160; </p>
<p>Of course, the old electrical grid will now be infused with devices governed by the <a href="http://www.techsectorweb.com/2009/04/the-impact-of-computing-78-more-each-year.html">Impact of Computing</a>, which means that a household smart meters and control monitors&#0160;will drop in cost annually, and necessitate upgrades every few years.&#0160; Count this as one or more computing nodes entering into the average home.&#0160; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/oct2009/tc2009105_096734.htm">Businessweek has a comprehensive article on the SmartGrid, with a slideshow of technologies.&#0160; </a></p>

BODY:
<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px;">Here at TechSector, we maintain a track record of predicting bubbles, busts, and recessions long before they happen.&nbsp; For example, <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2006/04/the_housing_bub.html">the housing bubble was identified in April 2006</A>, back when a person could be socially excommunicated for claiming that houses may not rise in value forever.&nbsp; After that, <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2008/02/recession-began.html">I have identified when the current recession started, months before most economists</A>, and have even <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2009/04/the-form-of-economic-recovery.html">predicted when the present recession will end, and at what level job losses would end at</A>.&nbsp; This track record will now lead me to set my sights on the next two troubles on the horizon, which will be the causes of the next two potential recessions.&nbsp;</P>
<P>1)<strong> 2011 :</strong> The tax cuts enacted by President Bush are set to expire at the end of 2010, returning tax brackets to what they were in 2000.&nbsp; Most middle class brackets will rise by 3%, and the top bracket will rise 4.6% from 35% to 39.6%.&nbsp; This is effectively a tax increase that will be upon us in 14 months.&nbsp; At the same time, the Fed Funds rate is at a record low near 0%, and has been for several months.&nbsp; This low interest rate has ended the current recession, but virtually guarantees future inflation.&nbsp; As the Federal Reserve is forced to raise interest rates, liquidity contracts again, the housing prices continue on the correction that was not allowed to complete itself in 2009.&nbsp; A mere rise in the rate back up to 3% could push housing prices down another leg, battering household wealth yet again, and driving yet more people into negative net worth.&nbsp; <strong>The housing correction is not fully complete until we have sustained a Fed Funds rate over 3% for at least a year.</strong>&nbsp; The timing of this could combine with the tax increase, which would&nbsp;create a joint burden too heavy for the economy to bear, causing a new recession in 2011.&nbsp; </P>
<P>This situation could be avoided easily,&nbsp;by reducing the budget deficit through the quaint notion of spending cuts instead of tax increases that&nbsp;stifle incentives and encumber small businesses.&nbsp; However, barring a seismic shift in the 2010 congressional elections that dispose of many Democrats and replace them with fiscally conservative Republicans (themselves an endangered group within the Republican Party), I do not see the government taking prudent preventive action.&nbsp; </P>
<P>2)&nbsp;<strong>~2017</strong> : For all the uninformed talk about a 'weak dollar', the damage of this will affect nations that export to the US more than the US itself. &nbsp;However, when&nbsp;the PPP per capita GDP of China begins to exceed the world average (by about 2017), then Chinese currency will have to rise to achieve convergence with nominal GDP, effectively adding several trillion dollars to nominal World GDP.&nbsp; This will lead to massive tectonic shifts in the global economy, none of which are destructive, but will result in confusion, for which the immediate reaction will be a US and EU recession (even amidst a rise in World GDP) until all of the following effects are sorted out :</P>
<P>a) The US will see a bout of inflation as prices of Chinese&nbsp;imports rise.&nbsp; At the same time, US exports will surge.</P>
<P>b) Oil prices will spike above $120 as Chinese purchasing power of oil rises, effectively creating greater demand.&nbsp; This will cause short-term pain, <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2007/10/why-i-want-oil-.html">followed by longer-term good as described here</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the good from an oil spike will be the collapse of many tyrannical petro-regimes, due to burning the candle at both ends, as detailed in the link.</P>
<P>c) Many of the developing countries that neighbor China&nbsp;(which are populated by an additional 2 billion people) will experience the gravitational pull of China's now huge economy, and see a forced currency appreciation long before they are ready.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will cause an unexpected set of changes in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, VietNam, the Philipines, and Indonesia (these 6 countries containing 2 billion people) as a massive adjustment process will have to occur in a very short time, toppling many industries and creating new ones within these countries.&nbsp; </P>
<P>d) After everything is sorted out, the US and EU will be significantly smaller percentages of World GDP, but the US would see higher GDP growth rates due to a near-elimination of the trade-deficit.&nbsp; Asia, as a region, would have a much larger economy than the EU or North America.&nbsp; </P>
<P>So these are the two possible recessions that the US faces, the first in 2011 and the second in the latter half of the next decade.&nbsp; Prudent fiscal management could&nbsp;sidestep the first, while the second is an inevitable byproduct of the adjustments borne of poverty reduction.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In any event, investment opportunities, and, more importantly, bullet-dodging opportunities abound.&nbsp; In the immediate term, however, if you are considering buying a home in an expensive US area such as New York or California, <span style="text-decoration: underline">do not buy one</span>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</P>

<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">Some of you may recall that over three and a half years ago, <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2006/02/the_end_of_rabb.html">on February 4, 2006, I predicted that by 2013, at least 900 million people in emerging nations, 80% of whom had no Internet connection in 2006,&nbsp;would have access to a wireless broadband connection through their cellphones</A>.&nbsp; That seemed like a bold prediction at the time.</P>
<P><A style="FLOAT: right" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20120a5bcef78970b-pi"><img  class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20120a5bcef78970b " title=Mobile style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px" alt=Mobile src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20120a5bcef78970b-800wi" border=0 /></A> But in the Economist, there is a special report on mobile phones in the developing world, and this chart depicts the progress towards my prediction quite nicely.&nbsp; Mobile broadband subscribers will go from nearly zero in early 2006 when the prediction was first made, to 1.4 billion by 2013 (of which 900 million can safely be assumed to be in&nbsp;emerging nations).&nbsp; </P>
<P>It is often said that no other invention has done more for so many people so quickly than the mobile phone, given the large number of people who did not have even a landline phone prior to getting a mobile phone.&nbsp; However, the inital deployment of rudimentary mobile phones was just the beginning.&nbsp; As 3G broadband at speeds greater than 1 mbps spread to a billion people with no prior Internet access, the entire nature of their existence is transformed.&nbsp; As per this second chart from the Economist report, the GDP boost from broadband Internet penetration is far higher than the already-impressive boost we have seen from simple mobile access, and we can thus expect another, stronger wave of human advancement as mobile broadband diffuses.&nbsp;<A style="FLOAT: right" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20120a62724ed970c-pi"><img  class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20120a62724ed970c " title=Mobile2 style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px" alt=Mobile2 src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20120a62724ed970c-800wi" border=0 /></A> Simultaneously, the entire nature of the Internet is also transformed.&nbsp; Think of the massive developmental catalyst such a rapid technological diffusion would be.&nbsp; Child literacy would rise as&nbsp;the educational materials&nbsp;of the full Internet will&nbsp;be available in locations where no libraries exist, making near-universal child literacy a reality within a decade.&nbsp; Agricultural and fishery supply chains will shorten tremendously.&nbsp; Disaster&nbsp;relief will become far easier, as will the apprehension of criminals.&nbsp; The upliftment&nbsp;that once appeared to be a process of decades will now happen in mere years.&nbsp; &nbsp; </P>
<P>We can thus proceed to the next prediction, which is that <strong>by 2020, 4 billion people will have 4G wireless broadband access on their handheld mobile phone, at speeds exceeding 100 Mbps.</strong>&nbsp; In other words, a landline speed that even wealthy Americans could not have in 2005 will be available wirelessly to billions of the very poorest people&nbsp;just 15 years later, in 2020.&nbsp; Imagine that.&nbsp; </P>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">The Singularity.&#0160; The event when the rate of technological change becomes human-surpassing, just as the advent of human civilization a few millenia ago&#0160;surpassed the comprehension of non-human&#0160;creatures. So when will this event happen?</span></p>
<p>There is a great deal of speculation on the &#39;what&#39; of the Singularity, whether it will create a utopia for humans, cause the extinction of humans, or some outcome in between.&#0160; Versions of optimism (Star Trek) and&#0160;pessimism (The Matrix, Terminator) all become fashionable at some point. &#0160;No one can predict this reliably, because the very definition of the singularity itself precludes such prediction.&#0160; <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2006/12/are_you_acceler.html">Given the accelerating nature of technological change</a>, it is just as hard to predict the world of 2050 from 2009, as it would have been to predict 2009 from, say, 1200 AD.&#0160; So our topic today is not going to be about the &#39;what&#39;, but rather the &#39;when&#39; of the Singularity.&#0160;</p>
<p>Let us take a few independent methods to arrive at estimations on the timing of the Singularity.</p>
<p>1) Ray Kurzweil has constructed this logarithmic chart that combines 15 unrelated lists of key historic events since the Big Bang 15 billion years ago.&#0160; The exact selection of&#0160;events is less important than the&#0160;undeniable fact that the intervals between such independently selected events are shrinking exponentially.&#0160; This, of course, means that the next several major events will occur within single human lifetimes.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20120a5075619970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="772px-ParadigmShiftsFrr15Events_svg" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20120a5075619970b image-full " height="453" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20120a5075619970b-800wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; width: 97.35%;" title="772px-ParadigmShiftsFrr15Events_svg" /></a></p>
<p>Kurzweil wrote with great confidence, in 2005, that the Singularity would arrive in&#0160;2045.&#0160; One thing I find about Kurzweil is that he usually predicts the <em>nature</em> of an event very accurately, but overestimates the <em>rate</em> of progress by 50%.&#0160; Part of this is because he insists that computer power per dollar doubles every year, when it actually doubles every 18 months, which results in every other date he predicts to be distorted as a downstream byproduct of this figure.&#0160; Another part of this is that Kurzweil, born in 1948, is taking extreme measures to extend his lifespan,&#0160;and quite possibly may have an expectation of living until 100 but not necessarily beyond that.&#0160; A Singularity in 2045 would be before his century mark, but herein lies a lesson for us all.&#0160; Those who have a positive expectation of what the Singularity will bring tend to have a subconscious bias towards estimating it to happen within their expected lifetimes.&#0160; We have to be watchful enough to not let this bias influence us.&#0160; So when Kurzweil says that the Singularity will be 40 years from 2005, we can&#0160;apply the discount to&#0160;estimate that it will be 60 years from 2005, or in 2065.&#0160;</p>
<p>2) John Smart is a brilliant futurist with a distinctly different view on accelerating change from Ray Kurzweil, but he has produced very little visible new content in the last 5 years.&#0160; <a href="http://www.accelerationwatch.com/index.html#singularityclock">In 2003, he&#0160;predicted the Singularity&#0160;for 2060, +/- 20 years</a>.&#0160;&#0160;Others like Hans Moravec and Vernor Vinge also have declared predictions at points in the mid/late 21st century.&#0160;</p>
<p>3) Ever since the start of the fictional Star Trek franchise in 1966, they have made a number of predictions about the decades since, with impressive accuracy.&#0160; In Star Trek canon, humanity experiences a major acceleration of progress starting from 2063, upon first contact with an extraterrestrial civilization.&#0160; <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2009/05/seti-and-the-singularity.html">While my views on first contact are somewhat different from the Star Trek prediction</a>, it is interesting to note that their version of a &#39;Singularity&#39; happened to occur in 2063 <em>(as per the 1996 film Star Trek : First Contact).</em>&#0160;</p>
<p>4) Now for my own methodology.&#0160; We shall first take a look at novel from 1863 by Jules Verne, titled &quot;Paris in the 20th Century&quot;.&#0160; Set about a century in the future from Verne&#39;s perspective, the novel predicts innovations such as air conditioning, automobiles, helicopters, fax machines, and skyscrapers in detail.&#0160; Such accuracy makes Jules Verne the greatest futurist of the 19th century, but notice how his predictions involve innovations that occured within 120 years of writing.&#0160; Verne did not predict exponential growth in computation, genomics, artificial intelligence, cellular phones, and other innovations that emerged more than 120 years after 1863.&#0160; Thus, Jules Verne was up against a &#39;prediction wall&#39; of 120 years, which was much longer than a human lifespan in the 19th century.&#0160;</p>
<p>But now, the wall is closer.&#0160; In the 3.5 years since the inception of The Futurist, <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2008/09/pre-singularity-abundance-milestones.html">I have consistently noticed a &#39;prediction wall&#39; on all long-term forecasts, that makes it very difficult to make specific predictions beyond 2040 or so</a>.&#0160;&#0160;In contrast, it was not very hard to predict the state of technology in 1930 from the year 1900, just 30 years prior.&#0160; Despite all the inventions between 1900 and 1930, <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2008/02/is-technology-d.html">the diffusion rate was very slow, and it took well over 30 years for many innovations to affect the majority of the population</a>.&#0160; <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2009/04/the-impact-of-computing-78-more-per-year-v20.html">The diffusion rate of innovation is much faster today, and the pervasive Impact of Computing is impossible to ignore</a>.&#0160; This &#39;event horizon&#39; that we now see does not mean the Singularity will be as soon as 2040, as the final couple of decades before the Singularity may still be too fast to make predictions about until we get much closer.&#0160; But the&#0160;compression of such a wall/horizon from 120 years in Jules Verne&#39;s time to 30 years today gives us some idea of the second derivative in the rate of change, and many other top futurists have observed the same approaching phenomenon.&#0160; By 2030, the prediction wall may thus&#0160;be only 15 years away.&#0160; By the time of the Singularity, the wall would be almost immediately ahead&#0160;from a human perspective.&#0160;</p>
<p>So we can return to <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2009/04/the-impact-of-computing-78-more-per-year-v20.html">the Impact of Computing as a driver of the 21st century economy</a>.&#0160; In the article, I have written about how about $700 Billion per year as of 2008, which is 1.5% of World GDP, comprises of products that improve at an average of 59% a year per dollar spent.&#0160; Moore&#39;s Law is a subset of this, but this cost deflation applies to storage, software, biotechnology, and a few other industries as well.&#0160;</p>
<p>If products tied to the Impact of Computing are 1.5% of the global economy today, what happens when they are 3%? 5%?&#0160; Perhaps we would reach a Singularity when such products are 50% of the global economy, because from that point forward, the other 50% would very quickly&#0160;diminish into a tiny percentage of the economy, particularly if that 50% was occupied by human-surpassing artificial intelligence.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20120a4f8cf4a970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Singularity" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d83452455969e20120a4f8cf4a970b " src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20120a4f8cf4a970b-800wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Singularity" /></a> We can thus calculate a range of dates by when products tied to the Impact of Computing become more than half of the world economy.&#0160; In the table, the columns signify whether one assumes that 1%, 1.5%, or 2% of the world economy is currently tied, and the rows signify the rate at which this percentage share of the economy is increasing, whether 6%, 7%, or 8%.&#0160; This range is derived from the fact that the semiconductor industry has a 12-14%% nominal growth trend, while nominal world GDP&#0160;grows at 6-7% (some of which is inflation).&#0160;&#0160;Another way of reading the table is that if you consider the Impact of Computing to affect 1% of World GDP, but that share grows by 8% a year, then that 1% will cross the 50% threshold in 2059.&#0160;&#0160;Note how a substantial downward revision in the assumptions moves the date outward only by years, rather than centuries or even decades.&#0160;</p>
<p>We see these parameters deliver a series of years, with the median values arriving at around the same dates&#0160;as aforementioned estimates.&#0160; Taking all of these points in combination, we can predict the timing of the Singularity.&#0160; <strong>I hereby predict that the Technological Singularity will occur in</strong> :</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 60px; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">2060-65 <span style="font-size: 50px; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">±&#0160;</span>10 years</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>So the earliest that it can occur is 2050 (hence the URL of this site), and the latest is 2075, with the highest probability of occurance in 2060-65.&#0160; There is virtually no statistical probability that it can occur outside of the 2050-75 range (sorry, Ray).&#0160;</p>
<p>So now we know the &#39;when&#39; of the Singularity.&#0160; We just don&#39;t know the &#39;what&#39;, nor can we with any certainty.&#0160;</p>

20 to 40 years away is not very long considering how far we have come. Our species is about 100K old yet we went from cave to moon and now to matrix in about 10,000 years. Wow. 

If we are so close to the Singularity then we are most probably already in it and we are running through various scenarios for any number of reasons.

<P>At that time, Cisco and Hewlett Packard both launched full-room systems that cost over $300,000 per room.&nbsp; Since then, there has not been any price drop from either company, which is unheard of for a system with components subject to Moore's Law rates of price declines.&nbsp; This indicates that market demand has been high enough for both Cisco and HP to sustain pricing power and&nbsp;improve margins.&nbsp; Smaller companies like LifeSIze, Polycom, and Teleris have lower-end solutions for as little as $10,000, that have also been selling briskly, but have not yet dragged down the Cisco/HP price tier.</P>
<P><A href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/news/ci_12992434">This article in the San Jose Mercury News indicates what sort of savings these two corporations have earned by use of their own systems</A>&nbsp;:</P>
<blockquote dir=ltr>
<P></P>
<P><span style="COLOR: #8b8b8b; FONT-FAMILY: Trebuchet MS">In a trend that could transform the way companies do business, Cisco Systems has slashed its annual travel budget by two-thirds — from $750 million to $240 million — by using similar conferencing technology to replace air travel and hotel bills for its vast workforce. </span></P>
<P><span style="COLOR: #8b8b8b; FONT-FAMILY: Trebuchet MS">Likewise, Hewlett-Packard says it sliced 30 percent of its travel expenses from 2007 to 2008 — and expects even better results for 2009 — in large part because of its video conference technology.</span></P></blockquote>
<P>If Cisco can chop its travel expenses by two-thirds, and save $500 million per year (which increases their annual profit by a not-insignificant 6-10%), then every other large corporation can save a similar magnitude of money.&nbsp; For corporations with very narrow operating margins, the savings could have a dramatic impact on operating earnings, and therefore stock price.&nbsp; The Fortune 500 alone (excluding airline and hotel companies) could collectively save $100 billion per year, in a wave set to&nbsp;begin immediately if either Cisco or HP drops the price of their solution, which may happen in a matter of months.&nbsp; We will soon see that&nbsp;for every&nbsp;$20 that corporations used to spend on air travel and hotels,&nbsp;they will instead be spending only $1 on videoconferencing expenses.&nbsp; This is gigantic gain in enterprise productivity.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Needless to say, high-margin airline revenue from&nbsp;flights between major business centers (such as San Francisco-Taipei or New York-London) will be slashed, and airlines will have to consolidate to fewer flights, making suitability for business travel even less flexible and losing even more passengers.&nbsp; Hotels will have to consolidate, and taxis and restaurants&nbsp;in business hubs will suffer as well.&nbsp; But these are merely the most obvious of disruptions.&nbsp; What is even more interesting are the less obvious ripple effects that only manifest a few years later, which are :</P>
<P><strong>1) Employee Time and&nbsp;Hassle&nbsp;:</strong> Anyone who has had to travel to another continent for a Mon-Fri workweek trip knows that the process of taking a taxi to the airport, waiting 2 hours at the airport, the flight itself, and the ride to the final destination consumes most of the weekends on either side of the trip.&nbsp; Most senior executives log over 200,000 miles of flight per year.&nbsp; This is a huge drag on personal time and quality of life.&nbsp; Travel on weekdays consume productive time that the employer could benefit from, which for senior executives, could be worth thousands of dollars per hour.&nbsp; Furthermore, in an era of superviruses, we have already seen SARS, bird flu, and swine flu as global pandemic threats within the last few years.&nbsp; A reduction of business travel will slow down the rate at which such viruses can spread across the globe and make quarantines less inconvenient for business (although tourist travel and remaining business travel are still carriers of this).&nbsp; </P>
<P><strong>2) Real Estate Prices in Expensive Areas :</strong> Home prices in Manhattan and Silicon Valley are presently 4X or more higher than a home of the same square footage 80 miles away.&nbsp; By 2015, the single-screen solution that Cisco sells for $80,000 today may cost as little as $2000, and those from LifeSize and others may be even cheaper,&nbsp;so hosting meetings with colleagues from a home office might be as easy as running a conference call.&nbsp; A good portion of employees who have small children may find it possible to do their jobs in a manner than requires them to go to their corporate office only once or twice a week.&nbsp; If even 20% of employees choose to flee the high-cost&nbsp;housing near their offices, the real estate prices in Manhattan and Silicon Valley will deflate significantly.&nbsp; While this is bad news for owners of real-estate in such areas, it is excellent news for new entrants, who will see an increase in their purchasing power.&nbsp; </P>
<P><strong>3) Passenger Aviation Technological Leap :</strong> Airlines and aircraft manufacturers&nbsp;have little recourse but to respond to these disruptions with innovations of their own, of which the only compelling possibility is to have&nbsp;each journey take far less time.&nbsp; It is apparent that there has been little improvement in the speed of passenger aircraft in the last 40 years.&nbsp; <A href="http://www.foresight.org/nanodot/?p=3192">J. Storrs Hall at the Foresight Institute has an article up with a chart that shows the improvements and total flattening of the speed of passenger airline travel</A>.&nbsp; The cost of staying below Mach 1 vs. being above it are very different, as much as 3X, which accounts for the sudden halt in speed gains just below the speed of sound after the early 1960s.&nbsp; However, the technologies of supersonic aircraft (which exist, of course, in military planes) are dropping in price, and it is possible that suborbital passenger flight could be available for the cost of a first-class ticket by 2025.&nbsp; The Ansari X-prize contest and Space Ship Two have already demonstrated early incarnations of what could scale up to larger planes.&nbsp; This will not reverse the video-conferencing trend, of course, but it will make the airlines more competitive for those interactions that have to be in person.&nbsp; </P>
<P>So we are about to see a cascade of disruptions pulsate through the global economy.&nbsp; While in 2009, you may have no choice but to take&nbsp;a 14-hour flight (each way) to Asia, in 2025, the similar situation may present you with a choice between handling the meeting with the videoconferencing system in your home office vs. taking a 2-hour suborbital flight to Asia.&nbsp; </P>
<P>This, my friends, is progress.&nbsp; </P>

BODY:
<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px;">On April 1, 2006, I wrote a detailed article on the revolutionary changes that were to occur in the concept of home entertainment by 2012 (see <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2006/04/the_next_big_th.html">Part I</A> and <A href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/04/the_next_big_th_1.html">Part II</A> of the article).&nbsp; Now, in 2009, half of the time within the six-year span&nbsp;between the original article and the prediction has elapsed.&nbsp; Of course, given the <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2006/12/are_you_acceler.html">exponential nature of progress</A>, much more&nbsp;happens within the second half of any prediction horizon relative to the first half.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The prediction issued in 2006 was:</P>
<P><span style="COLOR: #006633">Video Gaming (which will no longer be called this) will become a form of entertainment so widely and deeply&nbsp;partaken in&nbsp;that it will reduce the time spent on watching network television to half of what it is (in 2006), by 2012.</span></P>
<P>The basis of the prediction was detailed in&nbsp;various points from the original article, which in combination would lead to the outcome of the prediction.&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress as of 2009 around these points is as follows :</P>
<P><strong>1) Video game graphics continue to improve :</strong> <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2006/01/the_technologic.html">Note the progress of graphics at 10-year intervals starting from 1976</A>.&nbsp; Projecting the same trend, 2012 will feature many games with graphics that rival that of CGI films, which itself can be charted by comparing Pixar's 'Toy Story' from 1995 to 'Up' from 2009.&nbsp; <A href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-MOJJ5dLdk">See this demonstration from the 2009 game 'Heavy Rain'</A>, which arguably exceeds the graphical quality of many CGI films from the 1990s.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>The number of polygons per square inch on the screen is a technology that is closely tied to <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2009/04/the-impact-of-computing-78-more-per-year-v20.html">The Impact of Computing</A>, and can only rise steadily.&nbsp; The 'uncanny valley' is a hurdle that designers and animators will take a couple of years to overcome, but overcoming this barrier is inevitable as well.&nbsp; </P>
<P><strong>2) Flat-screen HDTVs reach commodity prices</strong> : This has already happened, and prices will continue to drop so that by 2012, 50-inch sets with high resolution will be under $1000.&nbsp; A thin television is important, as it clears the room to allow more space for the movement of the player.&nbsp; A large size and high resolution are equally important, in order to create an immersive visual experience.&nbsp; </P>
<P>We are rapidly trending towards LED and Organic LED (OLED) technologies that will enable TVs to be less than one centimeter thick, with ultra-high resolution.&nbsp; </P>
<P><strong>3) Speech and motion recognition as control technologies</strong> : When the original article was written on April 1, 2006, the Nintendo Wii was not yet available in the market.&nbsp; But as of June 2009, 50 million units of the Wii have sold, and many of these customers did not own any game console prior to the Wii.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The traditional handheld controllers are very limited in this regard, despite being used by hundreds of millions of users for three decades.&nbsp; If the interaction that a user can have with a game is more natural, the game becomes more immersive to the human senses.&nbsp; <A href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HluWsMlfj68">See this demonstration from Microsoft for their 'Project Natal' interface technology, due for release in 2010</A>.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Furthermore, haptic technologies have made great strides, <A href="http://singularityhub.com/2009/07/31/haptics-unleashes-virtual-reality-and-telepresence-revolution-awesome-vids/">as seen in the demonstration videos over here</A>.&nbsp; Needless to say, the possibilities are vast.&nbsp; </P>
<P><strong>4) More people are migrating away from television, and towards games</strong> :&nbsp; <A href="http://www.portfolio.com/culture-lifestyle/culture-inc/arts/2008/08/13/Tracing-the-Decline-of-Network-TV">Television viewership is plummeting</A>, particularly among the under-50 audience, as projected in the original 2006 article.&nbsp; Fewer and fewer television programs of any quality are being produced, as creative talent continues to leak out of television network studios.&nbsp; At the same time, World of Warcraft has 11 million subscribers, and as previously mentioned, the Wii has 50 million units in circulation.&nbsp; </P>
<P>There are only so many hours of leisure available in a day, and Internet surfing, movies, and video games are all more compelling than the ever-declining quality of television offerings.&nbsp; Children have already moved away from television, and the trend will creep up the age scale.</P>
<P><strong>5) Some people can earn money through games :</strong>&nbsp;There are an increasing number of ways where avid players can earn real money from activities within a Game.&nbsp; From trading of items to selling of characters, this market is estimated at over $1 billion in 2008, and is growing.&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12px; FONT-FAMILY: Trebuchet MS"></span><font size=5><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13px; FONT-FAMILY: Trebuchet MS">Highly skilled players already earn thousands of dollars per year this way, and with more participants joining through more advanced VR experiences described above, this will attract a group of people who are able to earn a full-time living through these VR worlds.&nbsp; This will become a viable form of entrepreneurship, just like eBay and Google Ads support entrepreneurial ecosystems today.&nbsp; </span></font></P>
<P>Taking all&nbsp;5 of these points in combination, the original 2006 prediction appears to be on track.&nbsp; By 2012, hours spent on television will be half of what they were in 2006, with sports and major live events being the only forms of programming that retain their audience.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Overall, the prediction seems to be well on track.&nbsp; Disruptive technologies are in the pipeline, and there is plenty of time for each of these technologies to combine into unprecedented new applications.&nbsp; Let us see what the second half of the time interval, between now and 2012, delivers.&nbsp; </P>

BODY:
<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px;">The United States of America has traditionally been the most economically innovative nation on Earth, and the best place for free-enterprise and self-accomplishment.&nbsp; It still is, but we cannot quite say that&nbsp;with as much certainty as before.&nbsp; Where did we lose our way?&nbsp; Why did America stop being able to dream the greatest dreams, and do the greatest things?&nbsp; </P>
<P>All this can be reversed almost immediately if the US government, private sector, and public really want to, however.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;eight&nbsp;straightforward changes could push US economic growth onto a permanently higher trajectory.&nbsp; These are not short-term stimuli meant to&nbsp;postpone the present malaise, but are ideas that have separately been floating around for a long time, but without a core theme to unify them.&nbsp; These are also not unoriginal ideas (such as raising the retirement age in corelation with rising life expectancy), or unrealistic ideas (such as exporting violent criminals to some poor country to be detained there at low cost), even if those ideas would be effective and popular.&nbsp; Instead, I aim to think bigger.&nbsp; Each idea presented, thus, has to surpass the $1 Trillion mark&nbsp;in direct and indirect benefits, yet still be practical enough to implement immediately (if the mediocrity of the decision-makers in power were not a barrier).&nbsp; </P>
<P>These ideas would usher in a permanent surge in the growth rate for the next 20 years, even though some of them would also bring an immediate burst nonetheless.&nbsp; Most of the ideas are governmental, but there is one idea each for US corporations and for US citizens.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I hereby present a path to unprecedented prosperity for America : </P>
<P><strong>1)</strong> <strong>Immigration Reform</strong> : <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2007/05/further_thought.html">My detailed case for skill-based immigration can be found here</A>.&nbsp; In summary :</P>
<P>US immigration policy, at present, is exactly the opposite of what it should be.&nbsp; Presently, highly skilled immigrants who seek to follow the law are put through an excruciating&nbsp;process lasting 7-12 years, fraught with restrictions on the changing of employers and&nbsp;the spouse's right&nbsp;to work.&nbsp; At the same time, unskilled immigrants, many with criminal tendencies, have an incentive to enter the US illegally and consume services paid for by the US taxpayer.&nbsp; US prisons are filled with a disproportionate number of unskilled illegal immigrants, while the next Andy Grove, Vinod Khosla, Elon Musk, Pierre Omidyar, and Sergey Brin are faced&nbsp;with a tortuous, interminable ordeal that may lead them to conclude that coming to America is not as worthwhile as it was a generation ago.&nbsp; </P>
<P>If a corporation or a university can choose to accept only the best that it can get, why can't America do the same?&nbsp; I propose that the US allow&nbsp;quick and unlimited immigration for anyone with a bachelor's degree from a recognized university in their country (a list of institutions by country which the US DHS maintains on a website).&nbsp; This will create an influx of about 1,000,000 young, educated&nbsp;immigrants each year into the US, which is still lower than the number of unskilled immigrants, legal plus illegal,&nbsp;entering each year.&nbsp; It takes $200,000 to educate a child from age 4 all the way through completion of a bachelor's degree, so such an influx would effectively create a knowledge import of $200 Billion into the US each year.&nbsp; Only 30% of US citizens have a bachelor's degree, so these immigrants would increase the average educational level and median&nbsp;income&nbsp;of the country.&nbsp; Simultaneously, unskilled immigration, legal and certainly illegal,&nbsp;should be halted/prevented until further notice.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Every problem, from social security shortfalls to a surplus of unsold homes and cars to a lack of engineering and science talent in the US, will be solved.&nbsp; Healthcare cost increases&nbsp;would be contained as the supply of doctors, nurses, and physiotherapists rises.&nbsp; Every distortion caused by an aging population and the retirement of baby boomers will be offset.&nbsp; Political, economic, and even social/familial&nbsp;ties with India and China will strengthen, as most of these skilled immigrants will be from these two countries.&nbsp; </P>
<P>It is just about the most productive economic strategy that the US can employ, and would start taking effect almost immediately.&nbsp; The shockingly uninformed notion that such immigrants 'take jobs away' or 'depress wages' has been debunked in the detailed case, and is a belief held by reactionaries who fail to consider that the same jobs can&nbsp;be offshored out of the&nbsp;US to find their candidates if the candidate is not brought here.&nbsp; </P>
<P><strong>2) Tax Simplification :</strong>&nbsp;<A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2007/04/on_taxation.html">My detailed case for tax simplification can be found here</A>.&nbsp; In summary :</P>
<P>Time is money, and moreso than ever in a prosperous society.&nbsp; Before even discussing the reduction or increase in tax rates, there should first be a reduction in tax complexity.&nbsp; If a family earning $100,000 is currently required to pay $20,000 in income taxes to the Federal Government, so be it.&nbsp; <em>But at least let the process of calculating this tax payment take 20 minutes instead of 20 hours.</em>&nbsp; For a small business, preparing their taxes can consume as much as 80 hours per year.&nbsp; At present, the complexity of the tax code costs the US economy $400 to $600 billion a year in lost productivity and transactional wastage.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Is there any possible argument against this, aside from the need to provide loopholes to favored groups, who themselves still suffer from the complexity of the tax code, outside of their custom loophole?&nbsp; The present morass is a massive burden that is a disgrace to the spirit of free enterprise and unworthy of America.&nbsp; </P>
<P><strong>3) Tax Exemption for Entrepreneurial Innovators</strong> : The reason that innovation prizes like the X-Prize are so valuable is that they evoke <em>superlative</em> efforts out of their contestants.&nbsp; This is entirely the opposite of most charities, which merely give ambition-dampening handouts to those deemed to be needy.&nbsp; By some measures, a $10 million X-Prize creates $500 million or more of innovation value.&nbsp; </P>
<P>However, after one team out of dozens of competitors wins&nbsp;a particular&nbsp;X-Prize of $10 Million or so, they have to turn around and pay 45%&nbsp;of it in income taxes.&nbsp; So the real prize is just $5.5 Million.&nbsp; If the IRS were to exempt these innovation prizes from taxation, the cost to the US government would be tiny, relative to the value of innovation that the now-larger prize would inspire.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I would take this concept further, and state that anyone who founds a successful technology company should be exempt from taxes on his shares and stock options.&nbsp;&nbsp;Effectively, a tax cut for creators of jobs, technologies,&nbsp;and wealth, who are known as 'change agents'.&nbsp; Of course, proper restrictions must be made to prevent fraud,&nbsp;but this&nbsp;stimulus would create a tremendous incentive for entrepreneurial innovation, and actually lead to higher overall tax revenue from the surplus of new jobs created, as the employees of these companies are not exempt from taxes.</P>
<P>This is just about the&nbsp;highest gain&nbsp;targeted tax relief that could be employed, and, if combined with idea 1), would bring the most dynamic entrepreneurs to America from across the globe (at least 40% of Silicon Valley startups are founded by immigrants, even today).&nbsp; For an initial&nbsp;cost of less than 0.1% of current tax collections, we could supercharge the economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;History has shown that a&nbsp;society that is unfriendly to entrepreneurship is not a society worth living in, but a society where the entrepreneur is&nbsp;cherished is the best society of all.&nbsp; </P>
<P><strong>4)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Make Sarbanes-Oxley Voluntary</strong>&nbsp;: The 'SarbOx' compliance requirements make it far&nbsp;more tedious&nbsp;for a young company to go public.&nbsp; For a small public company, SarbOx compliance may cost $3 million per year in auditing and legal fees, which could otherwise be spent on research and development.&nbsp; Even 8 years after the end of the dot-com collapse, the flow of high-tech IPOs remains a trickle, while corruption has arguably not seen any general reduction.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The solution is to make SarbOx compliance voluntary.&nbsp; A corporation can choose to comply, and then let the market decide whether compliance to SarbOx should result in a share price premium, or discount.&nbsp; If a company that has chosen not to comply to SarbOx is later found to have conducted fraud, all other companies will see their decision regarding SarbOx reflected in their prices.&nbsp; If a company that does not spend money on SarbOx instead outcompetes its rivals due to more R&amp;D investment, let the market reflect that as well.&nbsp; The entirely different situations facing blue-chip corporations relative to fresh IPOs can thus be catered to.&nbsp; </P>
<P><strong>5) Reform Divorce Laws</strong> : Two single people pay higher combined taxes than a married couple.&nbsp; Beyond this, children who grow up with divorced parents tend to underachieve in many aspects of life.&nbsp; Yet, we currently have divorce laws in America that provide perverse incentives for women to leave marriages that traditionally would have been considered acceptable, and consequently for the next generation of men to not enter marriage in the first place.&nbsp; Thus, the percentage of adults in stable marriages continues to shrink.&nbsp; Incentives matter, and the present incentive structure has disastrous long-term implications.&nbsp; </P>
<P>A few decades ago, a person seeking divorce was required to provide significant&nbsp;justification.&nbsp; Now, 'no-fault' divorce grants quick divorce to either party, without any burden of justification.&nbsp; At the same time, the&nbsp;concept of alimony was meant to maintain a woman who did not have any financial security of her own, and to dissuade a man from leaving his family (i.e. when <em>he</em> was at fault).&nbsp; Both of these laws independently had&nbsp;merit in the era that they were passed.&nbsp; </P>
<P>However, both of these combined lead to 'no-fault alimony'.&nbsp; A woman can decide to not work at all while the husband is out working long hours, and still leave him on a 'no-fault' basis and <em>still</em>get payments from him for years, possibly forever if the marriage was long enough.&nbsp; This leads to many women abusing the law for financial gain, or at the very least, threaten the husband throughout the marriage, knowing that the power of the state is behind her.&nbsp; Perversely, the dutiful husbands are often the ones ruined by the machinery of the state under the current laws, while the 'bad boys' get off lightly.&nbsp; 70-90% of divorces are initiated by the wife due to this incentive stucture, and while feminists seek to punish 'bad boys', 'players', and 'deadbeats', it is actually the faithful, responsible men who usually suffer.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Given the extreme risks to a man entering marriage in present-day America, more and more younger men are deciding that it is simply not worth the risk.&nbsp; As a result, many good-hearted, average women who want nothing more than to create&nbsp;a picture-perfect family, will find themselves competing for a much smaller pool of men who are willing to marry, and thus many of these women will not find husbands within the window of their youth.&nbsp; Such market forces have&nbsp;accelerated the&nbsp;meteoric rise of the pickup artist (PUA)&nbsp;industry complete with seminars, coaches, blogs, manuals, support networks of 'wingmen', and hidden-camera footage of successful pickups packaged and&nbsp;sold&nbsp;as instructional courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is&nbsp;leading to&nbsp;an America of 'more cads, less dads'.&nbsp; While this may be fun for&nbsp;practicing PUAs, it is not a sustainable societal model for any prosperous country.&nbsp; Furthermore, many divorced men are forced to live off just 20% of their original income after being&nbsp;brutalized by the machinery of the state.&nbsp; The natural response from such men would be to not work as hard, but&nbsp;such a disincentive for productive work would be ruinous.&nbsp; As&nbsp;almost all&nbsp;technological inventors are men, why should an inventor paying alimony bother to invent?&nbsp; Why not become a PUA instead, since that is a skill that no one can take away from him?&nbsp; </P>
<P>If America (and other Anglosphere countries) make it too unattractive for men to marry, Anglosphere society will deservedly die.&nbsp; This is where social conservatives have been an abysmal failure,&nbsp;shambolically unable to see the forest from the trees.&nbsp; Their distracted focus&nbsp;on combating issues that are already done deals (abortion) or that affect very few people (gay marriage), while limiting their&nbsp;support of&nbsp;marital commitment&nbsp;to empty sermonizing about how marriage is 'sacred', has&nbsp;meekly ceded the defense of the fabric they hoped to preserve.&nbsp; Their sermonizing, against legally&nbsp;sanctioned financial&nbsp;incentives for divorce combined with growing misandry in the media, is about as effective as a pea shooter against steel.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The solution is to have either no-fault divorce, OR alimony, but certainly not both.&nbsp; Either one by itself may be fair, but the two in combination certainly is not.&nbsp; One of the two, preferably alimony, must end.&nbsp; The second solution is for social conservatives to get their priorities in order, under a new generation of leadership that understands the 21st century social and legal climate.&nbsp; </P>
<P><strong>6) Make Tax Day One Day Before Election Day :</strong> The fact that April 15 and the first Tuesday in November are as far apart from each other as they are has itself cost the American taxpayer trillions of dollars, only due to human psychology.&nbsp; If, however, elections were held&nbsp;precisely when the taxpayer is most irate with the wastage of taxpayer funds, fiscal conservatism will immediately become the highest priority of any political candidate.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The recent 'Tea Party' protests are a step in the right direction, but are still too unfocused.&nbsp; If anyone with Tea Party connections is reading this, please consider pitching this idea as a mission to focus the efforts around.&nbsp; All other objectives of tax reduction, spending restraint, and penalties for pork-barrel wastage will automatically flow as downstream outcomes of this.&nbsp; This would enable ideas 2) and 3) to become realities as well.&nbsp; Politicians will resist this, but when cornered into a debate, they will not be able to produce any&nbsp;persuasive excuse that conceals their desire to maintain the profligate status quo.&nbsp; </P>
<P>As you can see, many of these are&nbsp;policies that have existed in America in the past - when America was ascendant.&nbsp; Out of these six, even one or two would create a dramatic economic boom.&nbsp; I have no illusions that the mediocre minds in Washington would implement (indeed, <em>re-implement</em>) any of these ideas, or even have the courage to uproot the entrenched interests that profit from the moribund status quo.&nbsp; </P>

<P>___________________________________________________________</P>
<P>However, US corporations are not blameless in all this.&nbsp; The shortsightedness of&nbsp;many senior executives costs their corporations far more&nbsp;money than an approach that sees&nbsp;beyond merely the next quarter or the end of the fiscal year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P><strong>1) A Measured&nbsp;Balance&nbsp;Between Layoffs and Salary Reductions :</strong> During economic contractions, headcount reductions are often necessary, and often facilitate the process of creative destruction and reinvention.&nbsp; However, too many corporations are taking an axe, rather than scalpel approach to cost-reduction, that has collateral expenses that they do not account for.&nbsp; </P>
<P>A layoff involves granting 2-12 weeks of severance pay to an employee.&nbsp; When hiring resumes 6-18 months later (the average duration of most recessions), the employer has to spend time interviewing new candidates, paying them a signing bonus, and training them for a couple of months.&nbsp; Even then, the new employee may or may not be a fit for the organization.&nbsp; The whole layoff and re-hiring process has great inefficiencies and&nbsp;large transactional costs, leading to crashes in consumer confidence and then lengthy 'jobless recoveries' in the economy.&nbsp; </P>
<P>There are also hidden costs, born by the former employee and broader society.&nbsp; Divorces rise after layoffs, and the combination of many tragedies at once can often lead to the final tragedy - suicide.&nbsp; The employer bears costs too, as an army of resentful ex-employees can join competitors, tarnish the company's reputation in this Web 2.0 era, or, in the most extreme cases, mentally snap and gun down a few of his former bosses (which does happen from time to time).&nbsp; </P>
<P>At the same time, the concept of temporary salary reductions receives an illogical,&nbsp;knee-jerk dismissal.&nbsp; The stupid claim that it 'discourages top performers' seems to assume that hearing about a divorce, suicide, or foreclosure in the life of your former colleague of many years, or the prospect of a shooting,&nbsp;is somehow not as discouraging.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The solution is very simple :&nbsp;drain the bath water out systematically, rather than throwing the baby out with it.&nbsp; Most corporations have a 5-point performance rating scale, with 5 being the top, 3 being adequate, and 2 or 1 leading to necessary termination.&nbsp; A corporation could simply implement a reduction of 0% for employees rated at '5', 10% for employees rated at '4', 20% for employees rated at '3', for two quarters,<em> before taking the more drastic step of layoffs</em>.&nbsp; If economic conditions stabilize, the salaries can be restored (which itself is quicker and cheaper than recruiting and hiring new employees).&nbsp; If conditions worsen further, only then begin with either a deeper reduction or layoffs.&nbsp; </P>
<P>No one gets divorced or suicidal from the ripple effects of a temporary 20% pay cut.&nbsp; A few may leave, but those are likely to be average performers, and are leaving by their choice (and hence do not get severance pay). &nbsp;In fact, most employees may not even know who got how much of a reduction, due to performance ratings being mostly confidential.&nbsp; The dignity of the employee is preserved, the transaction costs of firing and re-hiring are avoided, and the 'jolt' to the employee, and thus collateral damage in society, is lessened.&nbsp; Thus, the sharp plunge and jobless recovery cycle is greatly moderated, and the drop in consumer confidence that is found at the deepest part of the recession is avoided, which quickens the recovery itself.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Some corporations already do this, and have been more successful than their competitors over cumulative business cycles.&nbsp; But the concept of longer-term planning on this issue is still absent in most large employers, and it is shocking that the value of gradual staging and restoration is not recognized.&nbsp; </P>
<P>_____________________________________________________________</P>
<P>Last but not least, there is an elephant in the room of economic reform.&nbsp; It is that of the US citizen, and one major aspect of the economy&nbsp;that is usually at the top of any list of economic issues.&nbsp; </P>
<P><strong>1) Americans Have to Adopt Healthier Habits</strong>:&nbsp;It is hard to go a single day without seeing an article about healthcare reform.&nbsp; However, I did not put it in my list of 6 governmental ideas, as I was never quite convinced that it is entirely the government's responsibility to keep Americans healthy, or to extend their lifespan, despite their abuse of their own health.&nbsp; Too much of our healthcare system is built around treatment, and too little around the prevention of illness in the first place.&nbsp; Personal responsibility to reduce the habits that lead to disease has to be taken by the individual, and so I am going to hold the pudgy feet of the average American to the fire.</P>
<P>While America is the best county in the world in most ways, in terms of dietary health, it sadly is just about the worst.&nbsp; What North Korea and Zimbabwe are to economics, America is to healthy cuisine.&nbsp; So much so, that most Americans don't eat actual food at all, but rather 'food-like substances' as Michael Pollan calls them.&nbsp; Dismantling and rebuilding the American diet will be about as hard as dismantling the USSR and Eastern Bloc.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease are the&nbsp;four leading causes of death in America.&nbsp; We spend, directly or indirectly, about $2 Trillion a year (15% of GDP) on these&nbsp;four diseases.&nbsp; Yet, a person can greatly reduce their chances of getting all four with some very simple adaptations.&nbsp; For all the anguish about life expectancy not rising quickly enough, and the need for more funding for&nbsp;research, the old adage of a penny of prevention outweighing a pound of cure still applies.&nbsp; US life expectancy would rise by 5 years if all adults did the following :</P>
<P>1) Do not&nbsp;smoke at all, and only drink a little, of either beer or red wine.</P>
<P>2) Do not&nbsp;consume sugary foods or drinks, fried foods, fast foods, or too many processed foods.</P>
<P>3) Make sure that 80% of what you eat is fruits and vegetables of as many different varieties as possible (fresh, not canned).&nbsp; Dairy consumption should be moderate.&nbsp; Red meat should be kept to an absolute minimum (no more than 2 times a month), and should be of the highest quality.&nbsp; </P>
<P>4) Berries, mangoes, lentils, whole beans, cauliflower, cabbage, beets, carrots, turmeric, garlic, green tea, avocados, wild greens, fresh tomatoes, salmon, olive oil, flaxseeds, walnuts, cilantro, oatmeal, yogurt, and dark chocolate should be favored ahead of all other <span id=fck_dom_range_temp_1245020389937_298></span>foods, for reasons too lengthy to get into here.&nbsp; </P>
<P>5) Cut every portion size by at least 10%, ideally 20%.</P>
<P>6) Exercise 3 times a week, for 30 minutes each.</P>
<P>7) Adopt&nbsp;a bit of&nbsp;yoga and meditation into your life.&nbsp; </P>
<P>That is it.&nbsp; Do just this, and you will gain both quantity and quality of years.&nbsp; No one disputes the merit of these habits, and most discussion of them centers around why&nbsp;the person in question lacks and discipline or willpower to stick to these habits.&nbsp; The death rates of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's would plunge, and healthcare costs would be cut in half (saving $1 Trillion).&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, since healthier foods are cheaper than unhealthy ones, another $500 Billion will be saved in consumer spending, to be better used elsewhere.&nbsp; </P>
<P>$1.5 Trillion saved per year, as well as 5 more years of life.&nbsp; Yet, Americans can't seem to do it, and often become hostile when it is suggested that this program is easy.&nbsp; It does not make much sense to whine about the lack of a cure for cancer before a person has taken the simple steps that can&nbsp;reduce their chances of getting cancer by 75% or more.&nbsp; More education through some government initiatives is not the answer.&nbsp; That has already been done to the extreme.&nbsp; You can lead a horse to water, and even force its mouth into the water, but you cannot make it drink.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Americans have to get their own health in order first, then talk about the healthcare system meeting them halfway.&nbsp; Currently, the healthcare system is expected to magically undo too many self-inflicted maladies, an admission most Americans are unwilling to make.&nbsp; </P>
<P>_______________________________________________________________</P>
<P>Just eight steps to be taken, six by the government, and one each for corporations and individuals, to create the Golden Age, where US prosperity would triple between now and&nbsp;2030.&nbsp; All of these ideas have to do with creating better incentive structures, with an underpinning of more personal responsibility.&nbsp; It is so simple, yet so distant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px;"><A href="http://futurist.typepad.com/techsector/2008/04/energy-vs-finan.html">On April 22, 2008, I wrote about how the Energy and Financial sectors had diverged from each other, up to that point,&nbsp;to a degree that rarely happens between any two major sectors of the market</A>.&nbsp; I proceeded to suggest a trade of shorting Energy while going long on Financials.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Let us see how that trade turned out, about 1 year after it was suggested.&nbsp; </P>
<P><A style="DISPLAY: inline" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201156fa38bef970c-pi"><img  class="at-xid-6a00d83452455969e201156fa38bef970c image-full " title=EF alt=EF src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201156fa38bef970c-800wi" border=0></A>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Both sectors did worse than the S&amp;P500, but as we were short on Energy, this is favorable.&nbsp;&nbsp;With dividends reinvested&nbsp;(which for Financials, were substantial), we come to total returns of :</P>
<P><A style="DISPLAY: inline" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201156fa39a89970c-pi"></A><A style="DISPLAY: inline" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201156fa39c3b970c-pi"><img  class="at-xid-6a00d83452455969e201156fa39c3b970c " title=Results alt=Results src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201156fa39c3b970c-800wi" border=0></A> &nbsp;</P>
<P>So this trade earned a return of <span style="MARGIN: 0px; COLOR: #ff0000; FONT-FAMILY: Trebuchet MS">-5.36%</span>, vs. <span style="MARGIN: 0px; COLOR: #ff0000; FONT-FAMILY: Trebuchet MS">-32.20%</span> for the S&amp;P500.&nbsp; This is a dramatic outperformance relative to the index, even though staying in cash would have been even better.</P>
<P>For a next step, I would cover the short on Energy, and double down on my long position in Financials, given the&nbsp;low current price of Financials.&nbsp; &nbsp; </P>

<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px;">The Wolfram Alpha engine is set to be launched.&nbsp; Rather than a search engine, it is an&nbsp;'answer engine' that interprets actual questions and answers them in accordance&nbsp;with their intended meaning.&nbsp; </P>
<P><A href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYhLsQPHNas&amp;feature=player_embedded">Here is a video&nbsp;demonstrating the Wolfram Alpha engine.</A>&nbsp; </P>
<P><A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2007/06/the_semantic_we.html">I have written about the Semantic Web back on June 11, 2007.</A>&nbsp; The Wolfram Alpha, at first, will seem rather underwhelming, and will merely enable high-school and college students (as well as bloggers) to conduct their research more easily.&nbsp; But as refinements accumulate and users go through their own learning curve, we could see a major transformation in Internet usage&nbsp;starting around&nbsp;2012.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The Wolfram Alpha will be the first mainstream experience of the Semantic Web, much as the launch of the Netscape Navigator browser in late 1994 heralded the arrival of the World Wide Web to the mainstream.&nbsp; The launch of the Wolfram Alpha will be a similar moment in technological progress, and while it will not be as much on an incremental jump in user experience as Netscape Navigator&nbsp;was, consider that when Netscape Navigator was launched, it could only be accessed by desktop PCs, as there were virtually no laptops and mobile phones in 1994.&nbsp; Furthermore, countries like India and China did not even have&nbsp;more than a handful of&nbsp;desktop PCs at the time.&nbsp; But today, in 2009, there are devices of many shapes and sizes, across many countries, than can access the Wolfram Alpha on the first day.&nbsp; </P>
<P>This does not mean that Wolfram Alpha will be the most successful Web 3.0 product.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall how Netscape failed to win the marathon despite the early dominance, and how Google surpassed earlier search engines like Lycos, AltaVista, and Yahoo.&nbsp; The technology, and the trends underlying it, always supercede any one company or individual.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Thus, we&nbsp;have arrived at&nbsp;the start of the third chapter of the Internet age.&nbsp; Web 1.0 (the information web) ran from 1991 until 2001.&nbsp; 2001-03 was a nuclear winter for the Internet, which ended with Web 2.0 (the collaboration web) that ran from 2003 until 2009, and Web 3.0 (the semantic web) will begin now, in May 2009.&nbsp; </P>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">
<p>Anyone who follows technology is familar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore&#39;s_Law">Moore&#39;s Law</a> and its many variations, and has come to expect the price of computing power to halve every 18 months.&#0160; But many people don&#39;t see the true long-term impact of this beyond the need to upgrade their computer every three or four years.&#0160; To not internalize this more deeply is to miss investment opportunities, grossly mispredict the future, and be utterly unprepared for massive, sweeping changes to human society.&#0160; Hence, it is time to update <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2006/02/the_impact_of_c.html">the first version of this all-important article that was written on February 21, 2006.</a></p>
<p>Today, we will introduce another layer to the concept of Moore&#39;s Law-type exponential improvement. Consider that on top of the 18-month doubling times of both computational power and storage capacity (an annual improvement rate of 59%), both of these industries have grown by an average of approximately 12% a year for the last fifty years. Individual years have ranged between +30% and -12%, but let us say that the trend growth of both industries is 12% a year for the next couple of decades.</p>
<p>So, we can conclude that a dollar gets 59% more power each year, and 12% more dollars are absorbed by such exponentially growing technology each year. If we combine the two growth rates to estimate the rate of technology diffusion simultaneously with exponential improvement, we get (1.59)(1.12) = 1.78</p>
<p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff; FONT-FAMILY: Trebuchet MS">The Impact of Computing grows at a scorching pace of&#0160;78% a year.</span></p>
<p>Sure, this is a very imperfect method of measuring technology diffusion, but many visible examples of this surging wave present themselves. &#0160;Consider the most popular television shows of the 1970s, where the characters had all the household furnishings and electrical appliances that are common today, except for anything with computational capacity. Yet, economic growth has averaged 3.5% a year since that time, nearly doubling the standard of living in the United States since 1970. It is obvious what has changed during this period, to induce the economic gains. </p>
<p>We can take the concept&#0160;even closer to the present.&#0160; Among 1990s sitcoms, how many plot devices would no lon<span id="fck_dom_range_temp_1240048003828_313"></span>ger exist in the age of cellphones and Google Maps?&#0160; Consider the episode of Seinfeld entirely devoted to the characters not being able to find their car, or each other, in a parking structure (1991).&#0160; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5l7lXSmjsQ">Or this legendary bit from a 1991 episode in a Chinese restaurant.&#0160; </a>These situations are simply obsolete in the era of cellphones.&#0160; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI9gjIydxmM">This situation (1996) would be obsolete in the era of digital cameras</a>, while the &#39;Breakfast at Tiffany&#39;s&#39; situation would be obsolete in an era of Netflix and YouTube.&#0160; </p>
<p>In the 1970s, there was virtually no household product with a semiconductor component.&#0160; In the 1980s, many people bought basic game consoles like the Atari 2600, had digital calculators, and purchased their first VCR, but only a fraction of the VCR&#39;s internals, maybe 20%, comprised of exponentially deflating semiconductors, so VCR prices did not drop that much per year.&#0160; In the early 1990s, many people began to have home PCs. For the first time, a major, essential home device was pegged to the curve of 18-month halvings in cost per unit of power.&#0160; In the late 1990s, the PC was joined by the Internet connection and the DVD player.&#0160; </p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, I want everyone reading this to tally up all the items in their home that qualify as &#39;Impact of Computing&#39; devices, which is any hardware device where a much&#0160;more powerful/capacious&#0160;version will be available for the same price in 2 years.&#0160; You will be surprised at how many devices you now own that did not exist in the 80s or even the 90s.</p>
<p><strong>Include :</strong> Actively used PCs, LCD/Plasma TVs and monitors, DVD players, game consoles, digital cameras, digital picture frames, home networking devices, laser printers, webcams, TiVos, Slingboxes, Kindles, robotic toys, every mobile phone, every iPod, and every USB flash drive.&#0160; Count&#0160;each car as 1 node, even though modern cars may have $4000 of electronics in them.</p>
<p><strong>Do not include :</strong> Tube TVs, VCRs, film cameras, individual video games or DVDs, or your washer/dryer/oven/clock radio&#0160;just for having a digital display, as the product is not improving dramatically each year.&#0160; </p>

<p>If this doesn&#39;t persuade people of the exponentially accelerating penetration of information technology, then nothing can.</p>
<p>To summarize, the number of devices in an average home that are on this curve, by decade :</p>
<p>1960s and earlier : 0</p>
<p>1970s : 0-1</p>
<p>1980s : 1-2</p>
<p>1990s : 3-4</p>
<p>2000s : 6-12</p>
<p>2010s : 15-30</p>
<p>The average home of 2020 will have multiple ultrathin TVs hung like paintings, robots for a variety of simple chores, VR-ready goggles and gloves for advanced gaming experiences, sensors and microchips embedded into clothing, $100 netbooks more powerful than $10,000 workstations of today, <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2008/07/surfaces-the-next-killer-ap-in-computing.html">surface computers</a>, intelligent LED lightbulbs with motion-detecting sensors, <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2007/05/a_future_timeli.html">cars with features that even luxury&#0160;models of today don&#39;t have</a>, and at least 15 nodes on&#0160;a home network that manages the entertainment, security, and energy infrastructure of the home simultaneously.&#0160; </p>
<p>Now, the economic impact of this is substantial.&#0160; <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2008/09/a-future-timeline-for-economics.html">Refer to the Future Timeline for Economics, particularly the 2014, 2024, and 2034 entries.&#0160; </a>Deflation has traditionally been a bad thing, but the Impact of Computing has introduced a second form of deflation.&#0160;&#0160;A good one.&#0160; </p>
<p><a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20115702ddda9970b-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"></a><a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20115702e11fd970b-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"></a><a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20115702e122e970b-pi" style="FLOAT: right"></a><a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201156f373384970c-pi" style="FLOAT: right"></a><a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201156f373362970c-pi" style="FLOAT: right"></a><a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201156f50cd02970c-pi" style="FLOAT: right"><img alt="Plasma" class="at-xid-6a00d83452455969e201156f50cd02970c " src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201156f50cd02970c-320wi" style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px" /></a> It is true that from 2001 to 2009, the US economy has actually shrunk in size, if measured in oil, gold, or Euros.&#0160; To that, I counter that every major economy in the world, including the US, has grown tremendously if measured in Gigabytes of RAM, TeraBytes of storage, or MIPS of processing power, all of which have fallen in price by about 40X during this period.&#0160; One merely has to select any suitable product, such as a 42-inch plasma TV in the diagram, to see how quickly purchasing power has risen.&#0160; What took 500 hours of median wages to purchase in 2002 now takes just&#0160;40 hours of median wages in 2009.&#0160; Pessimists counter that computing is too small a part of the economy for this to be a significant prosperity elevator.&#0160; But let&#39;s see how much of the global economy is devoted to computing relative to oil (let alone gold).</p>
<p>Oil at $50/barrel amounts to about $1500 Billion per year out of global GDP.&#0160; When oil rises, demand falls, and we have not seen oil demand sustain itself to the extent of elevating annual consumption to more than $2000 Billion per year.</p>
<p>Semiconductors are a $250 Billion industry and&#0160;storage is a $200 Billion industry.&#0160; Software,&#0160;photonics,&#0160;and&#0160;biotechnology are deflationary in the same way as semiconductors and storage, and these three industries combined are another $500 Billion in revenue, but their rate of deflation is less clear, so let&#39;s take just half of this number ($250 Billion) as suitable for this calculation.</p>
<p>So $250B + $200B + $250B = $700 Billion that is already deflationary under the Impact of Computing.&#0160; This is about 1.5% of world GDP, and is a little under half the size of global oil revenues.&#0160; </p>
<p>The impact is certainly not small, and since the growth rate of these sectors is higher than that of the broader economy, what about when it becomes 3% of world GDP?&#0160; 5%?&#0160; Will this force of good deflation not exert&#0160;influcence on every set of economic data?&#0160; At the moment, it is all but impossible to get major economics bloggers to even acknowledge this growing force.&#0160; But over time, it will be accepted as a limitless well of rising prosperity.&#0160; </p>
<p>12% more dollars spent each year, and each dollar buys 59% more power each year.&#0160; Combine the two and the impact is 78% more every year.&#0160; </p>

<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">All of us remember the dot-com bubble, the crippling bust that eventually was a correction of 80% from the peak, and the subsequent moderated recovery.&nbsp; This was easy to notice as there were many publicly traded companies that could be tracked daily.</P>
<P>I believe that nanotechnology underwent a similar bubble, peaking in early 2005, and has been in a bust for the&nbsp;subsequent four years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to elaborate.</P>
<P><A style="FLOAT: right" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201156f42d238970b-pi"><img  class="at-xid-6a00d83452455969e201156f42d238970b " title=Nanotech style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px; WIDTH: 217px; HEIGHT: 296px" height=326 alt=Nanotech src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201156f42d238970b-800wi" width=241 border=0></A> By 2004,&nbsp;major publications were talking about nanotech as if it was about to surge.&nbsp; <A href="http://www.luxresearchinc.com/press/LuxResearch_TNR2004_VOLUME_1_TOC.pdf">Lux Capital was publishing a much-anticipated annual 'Nanotech Report'</A>.&nbsp; There was even a company by the name of NanoSys that was preparing for an IPO in 2004.&nbsp; BusinessWeek even&nbsp;had an entire issue devoted to all things nanotech in February 2005.&nbsp; We were supposed to get excited.&nbsp; </P>
<P>But immediately after the BusinessWeek cover, everything seemed to go downhill.&nbsp; Nanosys did not conduct an IPO, nor did any other company.&nbsp; Lux Capital only published a much shorter report by 2006, and stopped altogether in 2007 and 2008.&nbsp; No other major publication devoted an entire issue to the topic of nanotechnology.&nbsp; Venture capital flowing to nanotech ventures dried up.&nbsp; Most importantly, people stopped talking about nanotechnology altogether.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The rock bottom was reached&nbsp;at the very end of&nbsp;2008.&nbsp; <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2009/01/2008-technology-breakthrough-roundup.html">Regular readers will recall that on January 3, 2009, I noticed that MIT Technology Review conspicuously omitted a section titled 'The Year in Nanotech' among their year-end roundup of innovations for the outgoing year</A>.&nbsp; I could not help but wonder why they stopped producing a nanotech roundup altogether, and&nbsp;I subsequently concluded that we were in a multi-year nanotech winter, and that the MIT Technology Review omission marked the lowest point. </P>
<P><A style="FLOAT: right" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201156f42e5b8970b-pi"><img  class="at-xid-6a00d83452455969e201156f42e5b8970b " style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px" alt=Forest src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201156f42e5b8970b-320wi"></A> But there are signs that nanotech is on the brink of emerging from its chrysalis.&nbsp; The university laboratories are humming again, promising to draw the genie out of its magic lamp.&nbsp; In just the first 12 weeks of 2009, carbon nanotubes, after staying out of the news for years, have suddenly been making headlines.&nbsp; Entire 'forests' of nanotubes are now being grown (image from MIT Tech Review) and can be used for a variety of previously unrelated applications.&nbsp; Beyond this, there is suddenly activity in <A href="http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/22130/">nanotube electronics</A>, <A href="http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/22257/">light-sensitive nanotubes</A>, <A href="http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/21938/">nanotube superbatteries</A>, and even <A href="http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/22321/">nanotube muscles that are as light as air, flexible as rubber, but stronger than steel</A>.&nbsp; And all this is just nanotubes.&nbsp; <A href="http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/editors/22997/">Nanomedicine</A>, <A href="http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/editors/22978/">nanoparticle glue</A>, and <A href="http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/22118/">nanosensors</A> are also joining the party.&nbsp; All this bodes well for the prospect of&nbsp;catching up to <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2006/04/mili_micro_nano.html">where we currently should be on the trendline of molecular engineering</A>.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The recovery out of the nanotech winter could not be happening at a better time.&nbsp; Nanotech is thus set to be one of the&nbsp;four sectors of technology (the others being <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2009/02/solar-powers-next-5-gamechanging-technologies.html">solar energy</A>, <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2008/07/surfaces-the-next-killer-ap-in-computing.html">surface computing</A>,&nbsp;and <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2009/02/the-end-of-rabbit-ears-a-billion-more-broadband-users-part-ii.html">wireless data</A>) that pull the global economy out of this recession in late 2009.&nbsp; </P>

<P>In the last 3 years, we have seen the Apple iPhone (now in a 2.0 version), as well as broad deployment of 3G service to cellular phones.&nbsp; Neither were available in February 2006.&nbsp; But these are small increments compared to what access to the previously unavailable 700 MHz spectrum will give rise to.&nbsp; The auction for the spectrum fetched $19.6 Billion, indicating how valuable this real-estate is.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Signals sent at this frequency can easily pass through walls, and over far greater distances than signals in higher frequency bands.&nbsp; More importantly, since wireless is the dominant (and often only) means of Internet access in many developing countries, the innovations designed to exploit the 700 MHz band in the US will inevitably be modified to supercharge wireless Internet access in India, Latin America, and Africa.&nbsp; An additional 1 billion broadband Internet users in developing regions will be connected by 2013, as predicted in Part I of this article.&nbsp; There are few technologies that can help pull people out of poverty so quickly.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In the depths of a recession, the&nbsp;events that spark the next expansion arise almost unnoticed.&nbsp; WIthin 24 months of this event, there will be a vast array of exciting wireless products and services for all of us to enjoy.&nbsp; Remember that today, despite the economy being in its darkest hour, was the day that it began.&nbsp; </P>

<P><A href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/earth/4287132.html?page=1">Popular Mechanics has a roundup of five new areas of innovation in harnessing energy from the Sun.</A>&nbsp; All five promise to make solar energy competitive with the cheapest sources of fossil-fuel energy, and many of these five technologies could work&nbsp;in combination&nbsp;with each other.&nbsp; The five technologies are the following :</P>

<P>Now, many of these technologies were invented before 2008, so this roundup does not alter the <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2009/01/2008-technology-breakthrough-roundup.html">fact that 2008 was a year of very low technological innovation</A>.&nbsp; However, all these innovations bode very well for a tremendous boom in solar power starting around 2010.&nbsp; Each technology has one or more startup companies mentioned in each section.&nbsp; The industry consensus is that solar power becomes competitive with conventional sources of power generation by around 2011, varying by the local cost of electricity and the solar intensity of a particular region (i.e Arizona becomes cost-competitive for solar before British Columbia does).</P>
<P>The greatest benefits, however, will accrue to emerging markets.&nbsp; Many poorer countries not only have electricity rates that are much more expensive than in the US, but these countries, being in more southern latitudes, receive greater solar intensity to begin with.&nbsp; Breakeven in these markets arrives even sooner than it does for the wealthy countries at more northern latitudes.&nbsp; Many villages in India, VietNam, Iraq, Egypt, and Indonesia will go from having <em>no</em> electricity to having photovoltaic electricity.&nbsp; </P>

<P><em><span style="COLOR: #0000bf; FONT-FAMILY: Trebuchet MS">Throughout history, poverty is the normal condition of man. Advances which permit this norm to be exceeded — here and there, now and then — are the work of an extremely small minority, frequently despised, often condemned, and almost always opposed by all right-thinking people. Whenever this tiny minority is kept from creating, or (as sometimes happens) is driven out of a society, the people then slip back into abject poverty.</span></em></P>

<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">The secret sauce of Silicon Valley is the tradition of leaving established companies to start or join new ones, secure funding from venture capitalists, build the company to a suitable size, and then either float or sell the company for a windfall to the founders and early employees.&nbsp; The incentive to continue this practice is the engine that keeps the fire of human technological innovation alive.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Silicon Valley's unique ecosystem has so far been nearly impossible to eclipse.&nbsp; The combination of research universities, the best and brightest immigrants from India and China, a culture of entrepreneurship, and a nearly perfect climate has kept the competitors to Silicon Valley at bay.&nbsp; In the 1990s, the prevalent belief was that the high cost of living in Silicon Valley would enable Austin, Dallas, Seattle, and&nbsp;Phoenix to attract technology workers and cultivate their own tech sectors.&nbsp; This did not happen, as the Silicon Valley ecosystem just had too strong of a gravitational pull.&nbsp; </P>
<P>This, however, should not be an excuse for complacency, or&nbsp;a belief that Silicon Valley is a bottomless supply of tax revenue.&nbsp; There are four&nbsp;steps that would make Silicon Valley prohibitively inhospitable to the formation of new ventures.&nbsp;The first two of these&nbsp;four steps have already happened, and the final two are set to happen, barring direct intervention.&nbsp; </P>
<P><strong>1) Sarbanes-Oxley :</strong> This attempt to reduce the risk of another Enron-style fraud has inflicted a cost on the US economy greater than 100 Enron collapses.&nbsp; In Silicon Valley, the crushing costs of Sarbanes-Oxley compliance (up to $3M a year)&nbsp;have dried up IPOs to a trickle, as the prospect of spending money of compliance that could otherwise be spent on R&amp;D is unappealing.&nbsp; IPOs are less frequent than they were even in the early 1990s, before the bubble, and start-ups can only hope to be acquired by a larger&nbsp;company.&nbsp; In the last 8 years, only two IPOs were large enough to be considered 'blockbuster' : Google and VMWare.&nbsp; This crushes the incentive to leave stable jobs to go work at a new venture.&nbsp; </P>
<P><strong>2) Immigration Torture :</strong> Any list of the most successful people in the history of Silicon Valley will quickly reveal that at least one third of them were born outside of the US.&nbsp; In response, America has chosen to make it much harder for more such people to come here.&nbsp; </P>
<P>While politicians pander to <em>illegal</em> immigrants with&nbsp;minimal education, they somehow refuse to make immigration easier for <em>legal</em>, highly-skilled immigrants who start new ventures in America.&nbsp; This is significant given the fact that about half of Silicon Valley's skilled workforce is Indian or&nbsp;Chinese.&nbsp; They could return to their home countries easily if it becomes too hard to stay.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Under current procedures, an engineer from India or China has to be on an H1-B visa for 6 years before he can get a greencard.&nbsp; If he changes employers during that period, he has to start the clock again.&nbsp; The immigrant's spouse cannot work during this period.&nbsp; Even after the greencard, it takes 5 more years to become a US citizen.&nbsp; More and more of the best and brightest are deciding that this&nbsp;11-year limbo is not worth it, and return to their home countries (eventually starting companies there rather than in Silicon Valley).&nbsp;&nbsp;In the&nbsp;1990s,&nbsp;Americans had not even heard of Bangalore&nbsp;or Suzhou.&nbsp; </P>
<P><A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2007/05/further_thought.html">I have written a detailed solution to this problem over here.</A>&nbsp; </P>
<P>___________________________________________________________________________</P>
<P>If these two factors weren't bad enough, two more negatives are about to be piled on.&nbsp; </P>
<P><strong>3) California State Income Taxes are Set to Rise :</strong> The budget shortfalls and underfunded pensions in California are a ticking time bomb.&nbsp; CalPERS, which invests in many of the top venture capital funds that nurture the growth of start-ups in Silicon Valley, is in a shambolic state, and has to add $80 billion in assets just to meet present obligations.&nbsp; The top income bracket in California is already taxed at 9.3%, and this is set to rise.&nbsp; Sales taxes are also set to rise.&nbsp; Due to this horrendous mismanagement worthy of a banana republic, California will soon reach a tipping point where taxes are so high as to destroy California's private sector.&nbsp; It would, of course, be better to reduce CA state expenditures, but government officials have made it clear that raising taxes is their preferred course of action.&nbsp; </P>
<P><strong>4) Federal Income Taxes are Set to Rise :</strong> If the Bush tax cuts are allowed to expire, then from 2011 onwards, the top income bracket will be taxed at 39.6% rather than the current 35%.&nbsp; Here, too, the concept of reducing expenditures is not palatable to Washington decision-makers.&nbsp; While this does affect the entire US equally, when this is combined with the increase in California Sate tax, the combined marginal tax rate in California rises several percentage points, and possibly&nbsp;rises well above&nbsp;50%.</P>
<P>The danger here is that each of these factors by themselves are not life-threatening.&nbsp; But all four of them in cumulative combination are deadly.&nbsp; So on top of the difficulty of conducting an&nbsp;IPO, and the brain drain out of Silicon Valley back to Asia, if the financial windfall that a worker receives after his startup makes a successful exit is taxed at a grand total of 50-55%, fewer and fewer people will bother to toil away for years in a startup.&nbsp; As a result, fewer startups will form in Silicon Valley, and instead will form in Bangalore, Shanghai, and Taipei.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Furthermore, after these forces have been in effect for a few years a simple reversal of the higher tax rates, dysfunctional immigration policy, and Sarbanes Oxley will not simply restore Silicon Valley to its prior grandeur.&nbsp; The technology centers in Asia will have achieved critical mass by then, and Silicon Valley&nbsp;will have permanently lost its exclusivity.&nbsp; It would never recover the dominance it once had.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Silicon Valley will be reduced to a location that still hosts the headquarters of HP, Intel, Cisco, and Google, but 90% of the employees of these corporations will be overseas, and startups will be rare.&nbsp; Silicon Valley will effectively become like Cleveland or Pittsburgh, which even today host the headquarters of more than 20 Fortune 500 corporations each, but still have a lower population than they each had in 1960, and cannot attract new young people to come and live there.&nbsp; Cleveland and Pittsburgh are still functioning societies, of course, but their economic vibrancy is irretrievably dead.&nbsp; </P>
<P>This bleak outlook can certainly be reversed if prompt action is taken now.&nbsp; Sadly, the current path is one that is set to have a smothering effect on Silicon Valley.&nbsp; </P>

Excellent article.  Also factor in the recession and its effect on job mobility and depleted nest eggs.  When the economy is bad, leaving your current high-paying job for the instability of a startup doesn't sound like a very good idea.  Also, most sucessful entrepreneurs aren't kids in a garage, they are VPs and execs in their 40s or 50s with industry experience, a rolodex, and some savings to fall back on.  Now these people have to rebuild their nest eggs and can't responsibly put their retirement, health care, or kids college education at risk.

<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">Each year, I post a roundup of technology breakthroughs for that year from the MIT Technology Review, and I now present the 2008 edition.&nbsp; </P>
<P>2008 was a year of unusually low technological innovation.&nbsp; This is not merely the byproduct of the economic recession, as some forms of innovation actually quicken during a recession.&nbsp; Furthermore, the innovations from 2006 and 2007 (linked below) showed very little additional progress in 2008, except in the field of energy.&nbsp; This also supports my observation from February 2008 <A href="http://www.techsectorweb.com/2008/02/is-technology-d.html">that technology diffusion is in an unexplained lull</A>.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The innovations in 2008 are categorized below :&nbsp; </P>
<P><A href="http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/21895/?a=f">The Year in Computing</A></P>
<P><A href="http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/21897/?a=f">The Year in Robotics</A></P>
<P><A href="http://www.technologyreview.com/biomedicine/21894/">The Year in Biomedicine</A></P>
<P><A href="http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/21900/?a=f">The Year in Materials</A></P>
<P>What is conspicuously absent is any article titled 'The Year in Nanotechnology'.&nbsp; Both 2006 and 2007 had such articles, but the absence of a 2008 version speaks volumes about how little innovation took place in 2008.&nbsp; The entire field on nanotechnology was lukewarm.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Most of the innovations in the articles above are in the laboratory phase, which means that about half will never progress enough to make it to market, and those that do will take 5 to 15 years to directly affect the lives of average people (remember that the laboratory-to-market transition period itself continues to shorten in most fields).&nbsp; </P>
<P>Furthermore, <A href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122227003788371453.html?mod=article-outset-box">The Wall Street Journal has its own innovation awards for 2008</A>, but this merely confirms that 2008 was a poor year for innovation.&nbsp; For example, the Tata Nano is chosen in the WSJ article, yet it is not available to consumers until mid-2009.&nbsp; Let's hope 2009 has more genuine innovations.&nbsp; </P>

<P>Into the future we continue, where 2009 awaits....</P>

<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">The Nation Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) said that the US has been in recession since December 2007.&nbsp; <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2008/02/recession-began.html">Of course, that is precisely the time I had given over on The Futurist, except that my declaration was back in&nbsp;February 2008</A>.&nbsp; So I arrived at the same timing estimation, just&nbsp;10 months before the Federal Government, back when knowing this would actually have been useful.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The longest post-war recession in the US&nbsp;lasted 16 months, so if this recession lasts beyond April of 2009 (which it very well may), it would be the longest post-war recession the US has had.&nbsp; Of course, this recession was shallow for the first 10 months, and only turned sharply lower in October of 2008, so 'duration' is not the whole story.&nbsp; </P>
<P>At present, the consensus is that all of 2009 will effectively be recessionary, putting the recession at 24 months in total duration.&nbsp; Whether this occurs or that pessimism itself is over-shooting remains to be seen.&nbsp; </P>

<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">Recent market turmoil has many wondering when the freefall will cease, and whether we are on the brink of a new Great Depression, which is supposed to happen every 70-80 years according to Kondratieff Wave theory.&nbsp; I don't believe we are on the brink of a depression, <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2008/02/recession-began.html">even though the present recession&nbsp;is already in its 10th month</A>.&nbsp; But it would be instructive to compare the current situation with prior market corrections, and judge the present situation in a historical context.&nbsp; </P>
<P>We can first start with a chart of the S&amp;P500, from 1950 to today.&nbsp; We can see that the deepest deviations from the trendline appear to be in 1950, 1970, 1974, 1982, 1987, 1990, and 2002.&nbsp; We shall term these instances as historical 'bottoms' for the stock market.&nbsp; All but the 1987 bottom were in the midst of economic recessions.&nbsp; </P>
<P><A style="DISPLAY: inline" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e201053583868e970c-pi"></A><A style="DISPLAY: inline" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20105358386ba970c-pi"></A><A style="DISPLAY: inline" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e2010535962f87970b-pi"><img  class="at-xid-6a00d83452455969e2010535962f87970b image-full " title=S&amp;P500 alt=S&amp;P500 src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e2010535962f87970b-800wi" border=0></A> &nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>From this chart, we can see that the time period between bottoms can be irregular, with over a decade passing between them, in some cases.&nbsp; 1974 and 1982 appear to be the deepest corrections.&nbsp; These bottoms coincide with recessions, but interestingly do not coincide with other major crises.&nbsp; The Cuban Missile Crisis, Kennedy assassination, and 9/11/01 did not induce major market crashes beyond the first few days.&nbsp; Now, we can take the datapoints of each of these bottoms, and chart the exponential trendline that connects them.&nbsp; This is purely a chart of index valuation, with dividends not included.&nbsp; </P>
<P><A style="DISPLAY: inline" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e2010535839c6a970c-pi"></A><A style="DISPLAY: inline" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20105359d8998970c-pi"></A><A style="DISPLAY: inline" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e2010535cc25ec970c-pi"><img  class="at-xid-6a00d83452455969e2010535cc25ec970c image-full " title=Bottoms alt=Bottoms src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e2010535cc25ec970c-800wi" border=0></A> &nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>From this chart. we can see that the equivalent value of the S&amp;P500 in 2008, as designated by the red circle, would be around the 1000 level.&nbsp; As of October 10, 2008, the S&amp;P500 is at 899, or 10% below the level of the bottoms trendline.&nbsp; However, we can see that both the 1974 and 1982 bottoms are substantially below the trendline.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The S&amp;P500, since 1950, has delivered an 11.4% average return, with 7.7% of that in the form of a rise in the index itself, and 3.7% of the return being in the form of dividends.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the long-term underlying growth rate of the index is 7.7%, we can chart a 7.7% compounded projection trend from each of these bottoms as another method to compare them to an approximate 2008 equivalent.&nbsp; We shall start this chart from 1970.&nbsp; </P>
<P><A style="DISPLAY: inline" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e20105357aeb88970b-pi"></A><A style="DISPLAY: inline" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e2010535963293970b-pi"></A><A style="DISPLAY: inline" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e2010535cc2605970c-pi"><img  class="at-xid-6a00d83452455969e2010535cc2605970c image-full " title=7projS&amp;P500 alt=7projS&amp;P500 src="https://futurist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452455969e2010535cc2605970c-800wi" border=0></A> &nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>It is apparent that 4 of the 6 bottoms cluster around a 2008 projection of 1100-1200, but the two deepest bottoms of 1974 and 1982 project to a 2008 equivalent of only 700-750.&nbsp; These should be considered the two 'mega-bottoms' that happen&nbsp;a couple times&nbsp;per half-century, with the other 4 being only smaller bottoms that happen every 7-10 years, whenever there is a recession.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Since we are presently at 900 for the S&amp;P500, we are about half-way between a smaller bottom and a mega-bottom.&nbsp; Therefore, do not be surprised if the S&amp;P500 does, in fact, dip into the low 700s in 2009, merely to match&nbsp;this correction&nbsp;to 1974/1982 levels.&nbsp; This would be a further 20% correction from the&nbsp;900 close of October 10, 2008.&nbsp; It may&nbsp;not happen, but it certainly could in&nbsp;terms of historical precedent.&nbsp;&nbsp;This also means that the Dow Jones Industrial Average&nbsp;would&nbsp;simultaneously decline to as low&nbsp;as 6500.&nbsp; Indeed, there is no&nbsp;guarantee that it could not go even lower, but that would he historically unprecedented.&nbsp; Even&nbsp;the 1932 bottom in the Great Depression was not deeper than the 1974 and 1982 bottoms, by these measures.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P><strong>The Good News :</strong></P>
<P>If the thought of a further 20% decline in the S&amp;P500 or DJIA is depressing, also consider the following :</P>
<P>1) After both the 1974 and 1982 mega-bottoms, the&nbsp;stock market promptly returned at least&nbsp;60% in the next 9 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;This also happened after the 1932 bottom within the Great Depression.&nbsp; </P>
<P>2) Never forget about dividend reinvestment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dividend yields are highest when the stock market is&nbsp;at the depths&nbsp;of a bottom, and reinvestment ensures&nbsp;that new shares are purchased at the lower prices.&nbsp; This enables the investor to enhance&nbsp;his&nbsp;returns when the recovery finally commences.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the 1970s, the major indices were stuck within a flat range for a decade, but dividend yields as high as 5% enabled total returns that were substantially better.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Considering&nbsp;points 1) and 2), make sure that you are in a position to capture the recovery,&nbsp;and are not forced to sell at the unfavorable&nbsp;prices of the bottom.&nbsp; This means that you must a) never hold any substantial margin debt, b)&nbsp;be positioned across a diversifed set of&nbsp;securities, preferably ETFs ahead of individual stocks, and c) watch as little financial news as possible, thereby reducing your chances of panic that could lead you to take ill-considered actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>Tremendous profits will be made by those who can steel themselves through this purging of the weak, and are subsequently prepared for the post-bottom recovery.&nbsp; Put daily volatility aside, and enjoy the historical times that we are experiencing first-hand.&nbsp; </P>

<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">I am of the belief that we will experience a Technological Singularity around 2050 or shortly thereafter. Many top futurists all arrive at prediction dates between 2045 and 2075. The bulk of Singularity debate revolves not so much around 'if' or even 'when', but rather 'what' the Singularity will appear like, and whether it will be positive or negative for humanity. </P>
<P>To be clear, some singularities have already happened.&nbsp; To non-human creatures, a technological singularity that overhauls their ecosystem already happened over the course of the 20th century.&nbsp; Domestic dogs and cats are immersed in a singularity where most of their surroundings surpass their comprehension.&nbsp; Even many humans have experienced a singularity -&nbsp;elderly people&nbsp;in poorer nations make no use of any of the major technologies of the last 20 years, except possibly the cellular phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Singularity that I am talking about <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2007/08/top-ten-transhu.html">has to be one that affects all humans</A>, and the entire global economy, rather that just humans that are marginal participants in the economy.&nbsp; By definition, the real Technological Singularity has to be a 'disruption in the fabric of humanity'.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In the period between 2008 and 2050, there are several milestones one can watch for in order to see if the path to a possibile Singularity is still being followed.&nbsp; Each of these signifies a previously scarce resource becoming almost infinitely abundant (much like paper today, which was a rare and precious&nbsp;treasure centuries ago), or a dramatic expansion in human experience (such as the telephone, airplane, and Internet have been) to the extent that it can even be called a <A href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2007/08/top-ten-transhu.html">transhuman experience</A>.&nbsp; The following are a random selection of milestones with their anticipated dates.&nbsp; </P>

"Interactive human-level AI in 2018" and "AI can pass the Turing test in 2040" are mutually contradictory.  If we have convincing human level AI in 2018, it isn't going to take 22 more years to prove that we have convincing human level AI.

So why are any of these statements and dates meaningful?  Did you just make up the dates?

You should pull together some of your technology estimates for storage costs, ram costs and cpu costs.  The "3M" machine (1 megahertz, 1 megabyte and 1 megapixel) was widely touted leading up to 1984; and this was a breakthrough combination of technology ushering in the GUI.  

One could have constructed a similar "3G" concept for 2004.  (1 Gigahertz cpu and 1 Gigabyte ram were reasonably available.  But my widescreen display only has 125megabits (32*2560*1600).  Gigabit local area networking was potentially available.  Presumably the 3G computer ushered in some user visible innovation -- probably the widespread internet; maybe video editing.

For 2024, the "3T" computer could well be defined:  1 Teraflops of cpu, 1 Terabyte of RAM, 1 Terabit/sec of networking, 10s to 100s of terabytes of mass storage, 10s of gigabits of display.  I'm not sure what the user experience breakthrough will be.  But this powerful system is not the AI system.

The AI system would show up around 2024 in a "3P" computer:  1 petaflops of cpu, 1 petabyte of ram, 1 petabit/sec of networking, 1 petabyte of mass storage, 1 terabit of display.

ces,

Not really, because we are talking about video games, vs. passing a test where a human interrogator is actively trying to find non-human flaws.

The best analogy would be the fact that Toy Story in 1995 had a certain level of graphics, but video games even in 2008 don't quite match that.  

Why would the 3P and 3T emerge in the same year of 2024?  Or do you mean a later year for the 3P?

<p>For 2009, the portfolio is quite simple.&#160; I believe that small-cap value and financial stocks are at historically compelling valuations, and have no choice but to rise.&#160; A few major technology stocks are also at attractive valuations.&#160; </p>
<p>So the portfolio will be :</p>

There would be a steep but brief depression, as existing real estate loses 90% or more of its value, followed by a huge boom as home ownership becomes affordable to several times as many people as today. I don't think that we are on the brink of such a revolution.</P>
<P>For me to be convinced, I would have to see :</P>
<P>1) Articles on this device in mainstream publications like The Economist, BusinessWeek, MIT Technology Review, or Popular Mechanics.</P>
<P>2) The ability to at least print simple constructs like concrete perimeter walls or sidewalks at a rate and cost several times superior to current methods. Only then can more complex structures be on the horizon.</P>
<P>I will revisit this technology if either of these two conditions is solidly met. </P>

<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em"><strong>2012 </strong>: Over 100 million new automobiles are produced in 2012, up from 70 million in 2006.&nbsp; All major auto manufacturers are racing to incorporate new nanomaterials that are lighter than aluminium yet stronger and more malleable than steel.&nbsp; The average weight of cars has dropped by about 5% from what it was for the equivalent style in 2007.&nbsp; </span></P>

<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em"><strong>2014 :</strong> Self-driving cars are now available in the luxury tier (priced $100,000 or higher).&nbsp; A user simply enters in the destination, and the car charts out a path (similar to Google Maps) and proceeds on it, in compliance with traffic laws.&nbsp; However, a software malfunction results in a major traffic pile-up that garners national media attention for a week.&nbsp; Subsequently, self-driving technologies are shunned despite their superior statistical performance relative to human drivers.&nbsp; </span></P>

<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em"><strong>2016</strong> : An odd change has occurred in the economics of car depreciation.&nbsp; Between 1980 and 2007, annual car depreciation rates decreased due to higher quality materials and better engine design, reaching as little as 12-16% a year for the first 5 years of ownership.&nbsp; Technology pushed back the forces of depreciation.&nbsp; </span></P>
<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em">However, by 2016, 40% of a car's initial purchase price is comprised of electronics (up from under 20% in 2007 and just 5% in 1985), which depreciate at a rate of 25-40% a year.&nbsp; The entire value of the car is pulled along by the 40% of it that undergoes rapid price declines, and thus total car depreciation is now occuring at a faster rate of up to 20% a year for the first 5 years.&nbsp; This is a natural progression of <A href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/02/the_impact_of_c.html">The Impact of Computing</A>, and wealthier consumers are increasingly buying new cars as 'upgrades' to replace models with obsolete technologies after 5-7 years, much as they would upgrade a game console, rather than waiting until mechanical failure occurs in their current car.&nbsp; Consumers also conduct their own upgrades of certain easily-replaced components, much as they would upgrade the memory or hard drive of a PC. Technology has thus accelerated the forces of depreciation.&nbsp; </span></P>
<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em"><strong>2018</strong> : Among new cars sold, gasoline-only vehicles are now a minority.&nbsp; Millions of electricity-only vehicles are charged through solar panels on a daily basis, relieving those consumers of a fuel expenditure that was as high as $2000/year in 2007.&nbsp; Even when sunlight is obscured and the grid is used, some electrical vehicles cost as little as 1 cent/mile to operate. </span></P>
<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em"><strong>2020 :</strong> New safety technologies that began to appear in mainstream cars around 2012, <A href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/03/advances_in_aut.html">such as night vision, lane departure correction, and collision-avoiding cruise control</A>, have replaced the existing fleet of older cars over the decade, and now US annual traffic fatalities have dropped to 25,000 in 2020 from 43,000 in 2005.&nbsp; Given the larger US population in 2020 (about 350 Million), this is a reduction in traffic deaths by half on a per-capita basis.&nbsp; </span></P>
<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em"><strong>2024 :</strong> Self-driving cars have overcome the stigma of a decade prior, and are now widely used.&nbsp; But they still have not fully displaced manual driving, due to user preferences in this regard.&nbsp; Certain highways permit only self-driven cars, with common speed limits of 100 mph or more.&nbsp; </span></P>
<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em"><strong>2025-30</strong> : Electricity (indeed, <em>clean</em> electricity) now fuels nearly all passenger car miles driven in the US.&nbsp; There is no longer any significant fuel consumption cost associated with driving a car, although battery maintenance is a new aspect of car ownership.&nbsp; Many car bodies now include solar energy absorbant materials that charge a parked car during periods of sunlight.&nbsp; Leaving such cars out in the sun has supplanted the practice of parking in the shade or in covered parking. </span></P>
<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em">Pervasive use of advanced nanomaterials has ensured that the average car weighs only 60% as much as a 2008 counterpart, but yet is over twice as resistant to dents.&nbsp; </span></P>
<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em">______________________________________________________________</span></P>
<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em">I believe that this timeline represents the the combination of median forecasts across all technological and economic trends that influence cars, and will be perceived as too optimistic or too pessimistic by an equal number of readers.&nbsp; Let's see how closely reality matches this timeline.&nbsp; </span></P>

<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">I have long been optimistic about Solar Energy (whether photovoltaic or thermal) becoming our largest energy source within a couple of&nbsp;decades.&nbsp; Earlier articles on the subject include :</P>
<P><A href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/02/a_future_timeli.html">A Future Timeline for Energy</A></P>
<P><A href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/08/solar-energy-co.html">Solar Energy Cost Curve</A></P>
<P>Several recent events and developments have led me to reinforce this view.&nbsp; First of all, <A href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=a-solar-grand-plan"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">consider this article from Scientific American, detailing a Solar timeline to 2050.</span></A> The article is not even Singularity-aware, yet details many steps that will enable Solar energy to expand by orders of magnitude above the level that it is today.&nbsp; Secondly, two of the most uniquely brilliant people alive today, Ray Kurzweil and Elon Musk (who I recently was fortuante enough to chat with), have both provided compelling cases on why Solar will be our largest energy source by 2030.&nbsp; Both Kurzweil and Musk reside in significantly different spheres, yet have arrived at the same prediction. </P>
<P></P>
<P>However, the third point is the one that I find to be the most compelling. There are a number of publicly traded companies selling solar energy products, many of which had IPOs in just the last three years.&nbsp; Some of these companies, and their market capitalizations,&nbsp;are : </P>

BODY:
<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">For those of you who have been reading my articles on the video game sector on The Futurist, know that I have been a fan of Activision (ATVI) since 2006.&nbsp; It was first identified, <a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/04/the_next_big_th_2.html">along with other gaming companies, on April 17, 2006</a>.&nbsp; After that, <a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/01/the-futurists-s.html">ATVI was a component of my 2007 portfolio, earning a 69.2% return</a>.&nbsp; Even for 2008, while I shed the other gaming stocks like ERTS, THQI, and retailer GME, <a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/11/the-futurists-s.html">I kept Activision as the only gaming stock, and one of only three tech stocks, in my 2008 portfolio</a>.&nbsp; Yet, it has delivered a 50% return since the start of the portfolio, after its strong Q1 results last Thursday.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">Everyone knows that the 'Guitar Hero' game is a blockbuster, but what is less understood is how such games that have customized controllers (a guitar, in this case) are the future of gaming.&nbsp; The multi-button controller is not appealing to adults at all, and as the guitar controller eventually inspires skis, boxing gloves, golf clubs, etc., the realism and hence market appeal of games broadens to even more demographics.&nbsp; Just note the success of the Nintendo Wii as another indicator of this trend.&nbsp; Read my article <a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/04/the_next_big_th.html">&quot;The Next Big Thing in Entertainment&quot;</a> on The Futurist for an in-depth analysis of this subject.&nbsp; Activision is set to launch three new Guiter Hero games in 2008, placing the company at the forefront of this major trend.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">The stock might be nearing the end of a momentum run after such a spectacular return, and I may cease to include it in future portfolios until it pulls back to a better entry point, but as a long-term bet in the technology sector, Activision is still one of the best stocks to hold.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">Energy and Financials are both large sectoral components of the S&amp;P500.&nbsp; Yet the two have diverged immensely over the last 2 years.&nbsp; Not since the technology bust at the start of the decade have any two sectors diverged so much from each other, and from the composite S&amp;P500 index.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">XLE is an exchanged-traded fund for the Energy sector, while XLF is the equivalent for the Financial sector.&nbsp; First, let us view a two-year chart :&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">While Financials only began to fall away in 2007, Energy has gone so high above the composite market that it reminds one of the technology bubble of the late 1990s.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">It seems quite obvious here that while it is impossible to identify the exact top of the Energy run, or the exact bottom of the Financials correction, it would be very prudent to sell any existing holdings in Energy (or even short Energy if you have the appetite) and rotate the proceeds into Financials.&nbsp; The gap could widen in the short term, but rarely do two sectors reach such extreme disparities that make a profitable trade so obvious.&nbsp; </span></p>

BODY:
<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">There are minor but growing elements of evidence that the rate of technological change has moderated in this decade.&nbsp; Whether this is a temporary trough that merely precedes a return to the trendline, or whether the trendline itself was greatly overestimated, will not be decisively known for some years.&nbsp; In this article, I will attempt to examine some datapoints to determine whether we are at, or behind, where we would expect to be in 2008.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">There is overwhelming evidence that <a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/12/are_you_acceler.html">many seemingly unrelated technologies are progressing at an accelerating rate</a>.&nbsp; However, the exact magnitude to the accelerating gradient - the second derivative - is difficult to measure with precision.&nbsp; Furthermore, there are periods where advancement can be significantly above or below any such trendline.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">This brings us to the chart below from Ray Kurzweil (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:PPTMASSuseInventionsLogPRINT.jpg">from Wikipedia</a>) :</span></p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=752,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/02/18/752pxpptmassuseinventionslogprint.jpg"></a><span style="font-size: 1.2em;"><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=752,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/02/19/752pxpptmassuseinventionslogprint.jpg"></a><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=752,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/02/19/752pxpptmassuseinventionslogprint_2.jpg"></a><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=752,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/02/29/752pxpptmassuseinventionslogprint.jpg"></a><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=752,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://futurist.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/02/29/752pxpptmassuseinventionslogprint_2.jpg"><img title="752pxpptmassuseinventionslogprint_2" height="480" alt="752pxpptmassuseinventionslogprint_2" src="https://futurist.typepad.com/techsector/images/2008/02/29/752pxpptmassuseinventionslogprint_2.jpg" width="601" border="0" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px" /></a>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">This chart appears prominently in many of Kurzweil's writings, and brilliantly conveys the concept of how each major consumer technology reached the mainstream (as defined by a 25% US household penetration rate) in successively shorter times.&nbsp; The horizontal axis represents the year in which the technology was invented.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">This chart was produced some years ago, and therein lies the problem.&nbsp; If we were to update the chart to the present day, which technology would be the next addition after 'The Web'?&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">Many technologies can claim to be the ones to occupy the next position on the chart.&nbsp; IPods and other portable mp3 players, various Web 2.0 applications like social networking, and flat-panel TVs all reached the 25% level of mainstream adoption in under 6 years in accordance with an extrapolation of the chart through 2008.&nbsp; However, it is debatable that any of these are 'revolutionary' technologies like the ones on the chart, rather than merely increments above incumbent predecessors.&nbsp; The iPod merely improved upon the capacity and flexibility of the walkman, the plasma TV merely consumed less space than the tube TV, etc.&nbsp; The technologies on the chart are all <em>infrastructures</em> of some sort, and it is clear that after 'The Web', we are challenged to find a suitable candidate for the next entry.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">Thus, we either are on the brink of some overdue technology emerging to reach 25% penetration of US households in 6 years or less, or the rapid diffusion of the Internet truly was a historical anomaly, and for the period from 2001 to 2008 we were merely correcting back to a trendline of much slower diffusion (where it take 10-15 years for a technology to each 25% penetration in the US).&nbsp; One of the two has to be true, at least for an affluent society like the US.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">This brings us to the third and final dimension of possibility.&nbsp; This being the decade of globalization, <a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/12/what_determines.html">with globalization itself being an expected natural progression of technological change</a>, perhaps a US-centric chart itself was inappropriate to begin with.&nbsp; Landline telephones and television sets still do not have 25% penetration in countries like India, but mobile phones jumped from zero to 10% penetration in under 7 years.&nbsp; The oft-cited 'leapfrogging' of technologies that developing nations can benefit from is a crucial piece of technological diffusion, which would thus show a much smaller interval between 'telephones' and 'mobile phones' than in the US-based chart above.&nbsp; Perhaps '10% Worldwide Household Penetration' is a more suitable measure than '25% US Household Penetration', which would then possibly show that there is no lull in worldwide technological adoption at all.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">I may try to put together this new worldwide chart.&nbsp; The horizontal axis would not change, but the placement of datapoints along the vertical axis would.&nbsp; Perhaps Kurzweil merely has to break out of US-centricity in order to strengthen his case and rebut most of his critics.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">The future will disclose the results to us soon enough.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em">In scouring the startup universe for the companies and technologies that can reshape human society and create entirely new industries, one has to play the role of a prospective Venture Capitalist, yet not be constrained by the need for a financial exit 3-6 years hence.&#160; </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em">Therefore, I have assembled a list of nine small companies, each with technologies that have the potential to create trillion-dollar economic disruptions by 2020.&#160; Note that the emphasis is on the technologies rather than the companies themselves, as a startup requires much more than a revolutionary technology in order to prosper.&#160; Management skills, team synergy, and execution efficiency are all equally important.&#160; I predict that out of this list of nine companies, perhaps one or two will become titans, while the others will be acquired by larger companies for modest sums, enabling the technology to reach the market through the acquiring company.&#160; </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em">1) <a href="http://www.nanosolar.com/index.html">NanoSolar</a> : NanoSolar produces low-cost solar cells that are manufactured by a process analogous to &#39;printing&#39;.&#160; The company&#39;s technology was selected by Popular Mechanics as the <a href="http://www.popsci.com/popsci/flat/bown/2007/green/item_59.html">&#39;Innovation of the Year&#39;</a> for 2007, and Nanosolar&#39;s solar cells are significantly ahead of the <a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/08/solar-energy-co.html">Solar Energy Cost Curve</a>.&#160; The flexible, thin nature of Nanosolar&#39;s cells may enable them to be quickly incorporated onto the surfaces of many types of commercial buildings.&#160; Nanosolar&#39;s first shipments have already occurred, and if we see several large deployments in the near future, this might just be the company that finally makes solar energy a mass-adopted consumer technology.&#160; Nanosolar itself calls this the <a href="http://www.nanosolar.com/technology.htm">&#39;third wave&#39; of solar power technology</a>.&#160; </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em">2) <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/">Tesla Motors</a> : <a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/12/the_tesla_roads.html">I wrote about Tesla Motors in late 2006</a>.&#160; Tesla produces fully electric cars that can consume as little as 1 cent of electricity per mile.&#160; They are about to deliver the first few hundred units of the $98,000 Tesla Roadster to customers, and while the Roadster is not a car that can be marketed to average consumers, Tesla intends to release a 4-door $50,000 sedan named &#39;WhiteStar&#39; in 2010, and a $30,000 sedan by 2013.&#160; The press coverage devoted to Tesla Motors has been impressive, but until the WhiteStar sedan successfully sells at least 10,000 units, Tesla will not have silenced critics who say the technology cannot be brought down to mass-market costs.&#160; </span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em">The simultaneous use of Nanosolar&#39;s solar panels with the all-electric cars from Tesla and Aptera may enable automotive driving to be powered by <em>solar</em> generated electricity for the average single-family household.&#160; The combination of these two technologies would be the &#39;killer ap&#39; of getting off of oil and onto fully renewable energy for cars.&#160; </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em">4) <a href="https://www.23andme.com/">23andMe</a> : This company gets some press due to the fact that co-founder Anne Wojcicki is married to Sergey Brin, even as Google has poured $3.9M into 23andMe.&#160; Aside from this, what 23andMe offers is an individual&#39;s personal genome for just $1000.&#160; What a personal genome provides is a profile of which health conditions the customer is more or less susceptible to, and thus enables the customer to provide this information to his physician, and make the preventive lifestyle adjustments well in advance.&#160; Proactive consumers will be able to extend their lifespans by systematically reducing their risks of ailments they are genetically predisposed to.&#160; As the service is a function of computational power, the price of a personal genome will, of course, drop, and might become an integral part of the average person&#39;s medical records, as well as an expense that insurance covers.&#160; </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em">5) <a href="http://www.desktopfactory.com/">Desktop Factory</a> : In 2008, Desktop Factory will begin to sell a $5000 device that functions as a 3-D printer, printing solid objects one layer at a time.&#160; A user can scan almost any object (including a hand, foot, or head) and reproduce a miniature model of it (up to 5 X 5 X 5 inches).&#160; The material used by the 3-D printer costs about $1 per cubic inch.&#160; </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em">The $5000 printer is a successor to similar $100,000 devices used in mechanical engineering and manufacturing firms.&#160; Due to the <a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/02/the_impact_of_c.html">Impact of Computing</a>, consumer-targeted devices costing under $1000 will be available no later than 2014.&#160; I envision an ecosystem where people invent their own objects (statuettes, toys, tools, etc.) and share the scanned templates of these objects on social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook.&#160; People can thus &#39;share&#39; actual objects over the Internet, through printing a downloaded template.&#160; The cost of the printing material will drop over time as well.&#160; A lot of fun is to be had, and expect an impressive array of brilliant ideas to come from people below the age of 16.&#160; </span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em">The reason Ugobe is on this list is that I am curious to see what is the next product on their roadmap, so that I can gauge how quickly the technology is advancing.&#160; The next logical step would be an artificial mammal of some sort, with greater intelligence and realistic fur.&#160; The successful creation of this generation of robot would provide the datapoints to enable us to project the approximate arrival of future humanoid robots, for better or for worse.&#160; Another company may leapfrog Ugobe in the meantime, but they are currently at the forefront of the race to create low-priced robotic toys.&#160; </span></p>

As more evidence for the Aptera-type technology making a big difference, consider the Automotive X Prize.  It's a race for 100 MPG vehicles, many of which will share technology similar to Aptera's (light weight, aerodynamic, hybrid drivetrain).  And it is to be held in 2010 - only 2 years away!

BODY:
<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">The US government usually declares a recession only several months after it has begun.&nbsp; I find the <a href="http://businesscycle.com/">Economic Cycle Research Institute</a> to be a vastly more reliable source of leading indicators.&nbsp; While the ECRI has still not declared a recession as 'unavoidable', the economic data of the last week tells me that it is, indeed, not just unavoidable at this point, but that it actually began in December 2007.&nbsp; It is far too late for any 'stimulus' to prevent a recession, nor will the EU manage to avoid hardship of its own</span><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">When <a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/04/the_housing_bub.html">I identified the pervasive nature of the Housing Bubble way back on April 13, 2006</a>, I stated that housing may do poorly in inflation-adjusted terms even for the next 20 years (until 2026).&nbsp; Few were convinced then, now only somewhat more are.&nbsp; But supporting data for my prediction of the housing bubble being an event of generational duration is accumulating steadily.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">Furthermore, when the US economy was not at any risk of recession on November 4, 2006, <a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/11/the_us_economy_.html">I wrote an extended piece to refute the broken clocks who always insist the US is on the brink of collapse</a>.&nbsp; I declared that if recession does not happen by the end of 2007, then the housing bubble will no longer be a cause of recession, due to the housing correction being lengthy (hence digestible) rather than sharp.&nbsp; As the recession began in December 2007, we missed passing into the safety zone by just a hair.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">As the question of recession is now in the past, the next question is when a recovery may take place.&nbsp; The drop in economic conditions between October and January was so steep, and the Federal Reserve's reduction in rates in January, while belated, was so large in magnitude, that GDP recovery may arrive as soon as Q4.&nbsp; But I am not making a prediction on recovery timing yet. &nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">World Broadband Lines in active use will reach 350 Million in 2008, and rise to 470 Million by 2010.&nbsp; Of equal significance, the <a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/02/the_impact_of_c.html">Impact of Computing</a> ensures that the cost of network bandwidth continues to drop exponentially, and thus the average speed of each Broadband line is also increasing by as much as 30% a year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">As both the number and the average speed of lines are increasing simultaneously, this combined growth enables continued Internet evolution to occur much faster than most observers are expecting.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 1.2em;"><a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/01/why_do_the_bigg.html">Technological changes often take observers by surprise</a> because they are fixated on just one advancing trend, while failing to notice another trend on a rapid collision course with the first.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">Web 2.0 emerged a mere half-decade after the Internet bust (2000-02) due to the simultaneous combination of greater Internet connection speeds <em>and</em> wider Broadband penetration, leading to a greater number of people <em>each</em> spending more time online.&nbsp; The total aggregate person-hours spent on the Internet grew dramatically, enabling new business models to sustainably exist.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">Thus, early in the next decade, the greater number of Broadband users, each with access to much higher speeds than today, will create an ecosystem that can sustain new Internet business models that may seem premature today.&nbsp; This will eventually be defined as 'Web 3.0', which could include technologies known today under the term of <a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/06/the_semantic_we.html">'Semantic Web'</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">Be watchful of the companies that could become to Web 3.0 what YouTube, MySpace, Facebook, Wikipedia, etc. were to Web 2.0.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em"><a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/01/the_futurists_s.html">On January 23, 2007 on The Futurist, I created an investment portfolio to be frozen at that time</a>, and evaluated on December 31, 2007 against the benchmark of the S&amp;P500 index.&#160; The portfolio incorporated principles, economic trends, and technologies discussed in other articles here on The Futurist.&#160; Dividends were reinvested, and so the price paid reflects dividend-adjusted cost-basis.&#160; Yahoo and Google Finance do tend to miss recording some dividends, so one must go to a more reliable site like Morningstar to account for the exact dividends.&#160; </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em">So how did the portfolio do?&#160; I achieved a return of <strong><span style="COLOR: #336600">13.3%</span></strong>, vs. just <strong><span style="COLOR: #ff3300">4.3%</span></strong> for the S&amp;P500, from January 23 to December 31.&#160; Most fund managers are unable to beat the S&amp;P500 index despite the advanced tools at their disposal.&#160; The fraction of those that can beat the index by a margin 9.0 percentage points is even more exclusive, putting this portfolio in the top 10% of all mutual fund results for this period.&#160; </span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em">As always, weightage matters just as much as stock-picking.&#160; The first two securities, amounting to 50% of my portfolio, were a total disaster.&#160; In fact, when I first created the portfolio, <a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/01/the_futurists_s.html">I listed FXI as a security that was strongly considered but left out</a>.&#160; FXI returned an eye-popping 83% over the same period, so if I had included FXI instead of ICF, the portfolio&#39;s total return would have exceeded 25%.&#160; But it was not included, so &#39;what ifs&#39; do not count.&#160; </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em">The India Investment Fund (IIF) was a star, more than compensating for the failure of the first two securities.&#160; But the real home runs came from the video game stocks.&#160; Three of the four outperformed the S&amp;P500, and two of those, Activision and GameStop, surged into the stratosphere.&#160; <a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/04/the_next_big_th_2.html">My selection and detailed analysis of this sector way back on April 17, 2006</a> yielded a spectacular payoff.&#160; As a quartet, these 4 gaming stocks returned a combined 49% over this period.&#160; </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.2em">So there you have it.&#160; Futurism is not impossible after all.&#160; <a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/11/the-futurists-s.html">I have already started my 2008 portfolio, and we shall see how that goes on December 21, 2008</a>.&#160; The same principles covered in the articles below, are being applied.&#160; Let us see if the success can be repeated or exceeded.&#160; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">One year ago on The Futurist, <a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/12/2006_technology.html">I posted a roundup of 2006 technology breakthroughs</a> from MIT Technology Review.&nbsp; Of the breakthroughs listed at that time, displays, plug-in hybrids, and solar cells showed impressive progress over the subsequent 12 months.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">Now, we arrive at the 2007 list, which has expanded from four categories last year to five this time.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;"><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/19986/">The Year in Software</a> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;"><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/Nanotech/19983/">The Year in Nanotechnology</a> : Stanford University research into nanowires that dramatically increase battery capacity is the most promising breakthrough of 2007, in any discipline.&nbsp; Think 30-hour laptop batteries.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">Most of the innovations in the articles above are in the laboratory phase, which means that about half will never progress enough to make it to market, and those that do will take 5 to 15 years to directly affect the lives of average people (remember that the laboratory-to-market transition period itself continues to shorten in most fields).&nbsp; But each one of these breakthroughs has world-changing potential, and that there are so many fields advancing simultaneously guarantees a massive new wave of improvement to human lives.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">This scorching <em>pace</em> of innovation is entirely predictable, however.&nbsp; To internalize the true rate of technological progress, one merely needs to appreciate :</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">We are fortunate to live in an age when a single calendar year will invariably yield multiple technological breakthroughs, the details of which are easily accessible to laypeople.&nbsp; In the 18th century, entire decades would pass without any observable technological improvements, and people knew that their children would experience a lifestyle identical to their own.&nbsp; Today, we know with certainty that our lives in 2008 will have slight but distinct and numerous improvements in technological usage over 2007, just as 2007 was an improvement over 2006.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">Into the Future we continue, where 2008 awaits..</span></p>
